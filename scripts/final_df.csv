3,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,modeling up something that is representing something in real life so your model is a scaled down version of a real life project a real life building that can be built from this model whereas in sketchup you're just pulling up masses and you're just playing around with the geometry of things revit is very much you've got wolves you've got floors you've got ceilings and you've got wool thicknesses with things inside the walls so you'll have a stud you'll have an outer face and an inner face all this kind of stuff seems really daunting it's not a trust me you'll see from this this course and so that's why you've got all these different components underneath the architecture tab for structure you're probably not going to touch any of this you're an architect this is going to be for you know the structural engineers the civil engineers that kind of stuff whereas you might touch on some of these things every now and then you might use a grid you might need the reference plane which is also under the architecture tab so as the grid you're probably never going to use this unless you're doing a little bit of structure yourself still never use this myself as an architecture student you probably don't need to touch this so we're going to skip over it systems obviously that's for systems if you're a mechanical engineer if you're a service consultant or something like that this is what you're going to be using i've used this for one project in architecture school and that was very basic adding in some ducts some terminals and some pipes and electrical stuff you're probably not going to use it and when you do you'll figure it out let's just skip over that the insert tab this is what we need right so we want to add the floor plan to our workspace so you're going to go to the insert tab to insert stuff that makes sense right i hope it does but we'll come back to this okay let's just keep going and then you can kind of guess what the rest of these do if you're annotating something you're going to go to the annotate tab if you need to analyze something you're gonna go to the analyze tab again i hardly ever use this the main ones you're going to need is the architecture tab the insert and annotate tab massing in site you might need the manage tab this is just to manage your project there's not much um apart from you know changing properties and stuff like that in here and then most of these other ones are from plugins which you might not see so really that's pretty simple there's three or four tabs you need to know about now you've got the properties panel to the left here,302.639-454.31899999999996,484,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=302.639s
4,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,this is where you change properties of the individual things you have selected at the moment i have nothing selected so it's got the properties open for the ground floor plan which is what we're looking at here and you might be thinking why is this a ground floor plan i just want my 3d view or something and that's when you go down to the project browser this is where you can look at your floor plans your elevations your ceiling plans your sections and then you've got all your families legends schedules all of that stuff is in the project browser and the reason why you've got these different views already set up is because we use that architectural template when we set up the project i'm going to just place a wall in the middle of my site here i clicked on the wall um button yep i clicked on the wall button in the architecture tab and now i can draw a wall in my project i'm going to hit escape there to get out of that hit it again so that i'm no longer creating wolves and that's a floor plan view of a wall but if we go into the east elevation you can see it there in the project browser if we double click that now you've got this wall we've just created wowzer if we go back to the ground floor plan up the top here this tab this brings us back to the ground floor so it's not creating a new view it's not changing anything you're now just opening up these views if i open the north elevation that's the wall in a north elevation view and as you can see it brings it up to the top here you've got the east elevation you've got the ground floor plan these are all the views that we've opened let's say i wanted to get out of these elevations if i click the x's oh no now it's gone or is it in fact it's not gone you haven't deleted that wall what you've done is you've just closed that view which is now available to access again in the project browser by double clicking in the project browser and so these are just opening up the views delete closing them is not going to delete any of your items that you've modeled up it's a really smart way of modeling because you model something in one view in your ground floor plan for example and it shows up in every single other view every change you make to this wall in the ground floor plan it changes it in the elevations and vice versa as you've been modeling up your building you have also been drawing your elevations your sections your floor plans your details everything you can think of in an,452.319-604.1600000000001,482,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=452.319s
5,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,architectural documentation set every change you make in the elevations to this wool let's say we go into the east elevation and we bring this wall in to 14 000. right you can see the dimensions there from there to there that's 14 000 millimeters that would probably be if we go back to the ground floor plan that wall just got shorter and now that is 14 000 millimeters pretty smart stuff so if we go into a 3d view with this button at the top here otherwise you can go to the view tab and you can click on the 3d view button here that will bring up a 3d view of our wall so this is the model space you can see what i'm doing here is i'm holding shift while using the middle scroll wheel and that rotates around this wall otherwise if i just hold the middle scroll button that is just going to pan across the screen and if i click on an object and i hold shift and i hold that middle scroll wheel i can now rotate around that specific object so that's pretty cool again any changes i make to this wall in the 3d view that's going to show up in the elevations as well as you can see that's just moved that out and the ground floor plan it's now rotated around bim technology is very smart and that's what revit is it's very smart but there's also a lot of problems that come with that which we will kind of find out in the near future so you just got to be careful that when you're changing something in one view it's actually changing it across your whole project in all of the different other views you can also access your elevation views with these elevation markers here that there is an elevation marker if i put my mouse over it you can see that it's an elevation if i click on that this is just the marker that is not going to move where the elevation actually is if i click on this little arrow bit here you can see that that is where the elevation actually goes at the moment all you need to know is that up the top here this ribbon that is where you're going to be doing most of your work that is your tool set i guess that is your toolbox of things that you can use for your project but then when you get to the properties panel which is this section here which actually you can drag off of the project browser so that's a bit more clear what i'll usually do is put this in the project browser on my next monitor so that i've just got a big workspace but let's not do that so we can actually see what's going on the properties panel here this is all of,602.24-753.1199999999999,493,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=602.24s
6,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,the properties of whatever you have selected at the moment there's nothing selected so it's the view properties which is the floor plan properties if i were to select this wall you can now change the properties of the wall and you can see that at the moment it's a basic wall which is double brick and 270 millimeters in thickness this is also where you change the heights and the thickness and where the wall sits things like that as you can see the base constraint is currently on the ground floor how do we know where the ground floor is if we go to our east elevation view or any of the elevation views you can see that there is a level set up with the ground floor with using the architectural template this is already set up for us and the ground floor is at zero but for example as we will get into if the ground floor is not directly on xero you'll usually be given a survey drawing uh giving you the contours of a site if you're doing this for a project you can adjust this according to that but in this case the ground floor is on zero and this wall is sitting on the ground floor for the base constraint if you were to offset that by say 200 millimeters that is now going to be 200 millimeters above the ground floor as you can see we can use the measure tool here measure between two references and we can just measure this and it will be 200 millimeters difference if we bring up the properties again to the left here for that wall you can obviously then change the top constraint at the moment it's not connected to any levels but if we wanted to connect it to the first level which is 4 000 millimeters above the ground floor we can click on this little arrow here if you can't see that whoops we're just going to you can click anywhere on there and then click the arrow and then we're going to say up to level one as you can see that just brings up the wall up to level one it is now 200 millimeters above the ground floor and it goes up to level one for the top constraint otherwise we can adjust that without constraining it to a level by going unconnected and then changing this to let's say 6000 and as you can see there's an apply button down the bottom or what you can do is move your mouse off of the properties panel onto the workspace and it automatically applies it for you next up you've got structural stuff,751.92-903.12,456,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=751.92s

9,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,forget our keys after school and we would just break through these little mini hobbit doors we called them yep that's nice kitchen uh living space i remember playing monopoly there and that's the front entrance again that's the main road and you'd enter in through there so this is what we are designing up boys and girls we're going to model up this house and there you have it that's not me that's my brother let's not look at that it's always good to know what you're modeling before you model it and now we can get into modeling up this building i'm going to delete that wall we're going to go to the ground floor plan view the reason why we're going to do that is because now we're going to insert the ground floor plan from the real estate website i'm going to click the insert tab at the top here in the ribbon and we're going to go to what do you think tick tick tick tick tick tick tick what do you think we're going to click we're inserting an image so click that button now we're going to go find where this is so if you've downloaded this go and find it go follow along with me if not you can watch that's okay we're just going to left click to place this and this is the floor plan it's a bit blurry because the resolution is but that's okay because we can see everything we need but the first thing we need to do is make sure that this is to the right scale how do we know that well as you can see the real estate people have nicely given us some of the dimensions that we need and that would be you know these areas here 3.9 by 6.8 so let's find a nice and easy one 4 by 2.4 let's press this measure button up here which is the same measure tool we used before but it's just a smaller icon because this is this is something you use quite often i'm going to click on that and i'm going to measure from the inside of the wall to here and as you can see that's about 15 000 millimeters so it's about 15 meters that is not four meters and that is not 2.4 meters and looking at the dimensions of this we can tell that the long side is this side here so this is going to be four meters and the short side is going to be 2.4 meters and so if that's 15 000 millimeters or 15 meters and it's meant to be four meters the scale is obviously wrong to change that what we're going to do is click on this image and we're going to click the scale,1199.84-1349.2,474,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=1199.84s

11,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,4 000 there was a lot of these changes which made a lot of problems we know about levels how important they are let's start creating some for this project i'm just going to drag this out using that little circle button and you can lock it onto the other one and it looks really neat so keep that in mind you want your project to always look neat all right so the ground floor is at zero now we need to know how tall the first level is going to be as you know this is a three three-story building there are three levels and so we need to set up these levels before we start modeling anything we're going to look at the photos again we're going to use these as references right and we need to know how tall these walls are and how tall some of the other walls are as well and whereas we only have a floor plan drawing we don't have any elevations how do we figure out the heights of these buildings and one way to do that is to guess in a professional practice there's a lot of this guessing heights for existing buildings unless you've done an actual measure up on site and it's really important to get the existing building 100 correct then you know you'll go to site with lasers and you'll figure that stuff out to the or you get it surveyed and get a professional to model up the existing building in most cases if you're just going to be demolishing it and you just need to show the demolition plan of what's existing you can just model up model it up pretty roughly with some guesstimate heights and that's what we're going to do here otherwise what i could do is go knock on my old house's owner's door and asked them to measure up their building and that probably won't go well so what i could do actually is if they haven't fixed it i could break through that hobbit door and just snip around their house and measure it up i'm not gonna do that so one way to do this is to count bricks right we know that a brick is roughly 240 millimeters in height i think i better double check that because i can't remember so they're 76 meals high most cases they're 90 mils i'm going to treat this as 90 mls because it doesn't have to be perfect and 90 ml is a lot easier to work within 76 so each brick is 90 mils high now we can just count how many bricks there are,1495.52-1646.559,448,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=1495.52s

13,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,steps are about 200 millimeters high that's the riser of a stair so if we go 7 times 200 which is 1400 let's just make sure we do this right so what i say 7 by 200 that's 1400 that means there's a height difference of 1.4 meters so in that sense we're actually going to make level 1 1400 and then the level one roof is going to be 3300 above this point so then we can create another level make sure you save your projects by the way i have not done this yet and you should definitely take a minute to save it so now we can create a level that is 3300 above that level there and you can see there's a little guideline that gives you dimensions and you can just go across there and you can see that it is 4700 you can place it anywhere and you can change it later that's fine but to make sure this is correct let's go 1400 plus 3300 and that's 4700 which is correct now you can move this point out to snap onto one of the other one of these other points and we're going to bring that one back as well and now you can see there's a little lock there that's locked all three of these together so now if we want to move these dimensions for any reason it's going to move all of them that's just something to keep in mind when you see see this lock you can click it to unlock it and now it can move freely but if you want to lock it to all three of them you just press the lock button again now i'm going to move this one back over and snap that on to there and we're going to call this not level two we're going to call this level one roof you like to rename the corresponding views yes what does that mean when you create a new level what you're actually doing is creating a new floor plan in this case you can see that we've just created level one this floor level here this level and level one roof which is that level we've just created now if we double click on that that is the roof plan you could say four level one on here this is level one floor plan let's continue to create levels next up we're gonna find that the next level is another 1400 up because that's seven steps seven times two hundred fourteen hundred fourteen hundred millimeters up from level one so that means the next,1791.679-1943.0390000000002,443,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=1791.679s
14,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 1 - Setup,level is going to be fourteen hundred plus fourteen hundred which is two thousand eight hundred and i'm just going to place this anywhere and then click on that parameter there and type 2 800. and now that says level 3 this is going to be level 2. yes we want to rename it so that it updates in here you can see we know we've now got a level two floor plan which is very handy and we've now got our ground floor level one level set up level two levels set up we've got the level one roof we know that's at 4700 if we go back to the start we want to know the roof height up here right and we're also going to want to know you know what's this carport height and some of these other things which we can come back to but for now let's just get the levels for the floor plans and then also their roof heights so that we can extend some wolves up up here i'm going to assume it's probably the same height as this but in our sense we can count the bricks and this is pretty low resolution so it's going to be a bit hard but you can kind of guess where what each brick is you can go one two three four five six i'm going to say about 34 again and let's say that if it's not bricks how do you find the height of a wall if it's not bricks and in that sense you kind of have to go off what's around it we know about scale this is why we put humans in our architectural drawings because we know the scale of a human if there's a person standing next to this wall and they're standing about here you know that that mark there is a roughly 1.7 meters because that's how tall someone is in this sense we know that a plant pot is probably about 600 mils tall right well this looks about 600 mils tall so then you can kind of calculate well that's 600 that's 1200 that's 1800 that's 2400 that's 3000 and then 3400 just to add on to the top there so that's how we can you know use the surrounding context to figure out how tall this building actually is so we're going to say it's 3 400 so then again we're going to go 2 800 because this is level 2 2800 plus 3400 and that's six thousand two hundred millimeters so we're going to create another level and we're going to go i can't remember what i said 6200 we're going to go from this side just to make it a bit easier and we're going to snap it onto there and you can see that that's got the two,1941.679-2092.24,479,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JNQh6hyEXg&t=1941.679s

16,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,welcome to part two of the beginner's revit course we'll be learning about type properties and materials in revit so that we can begin modeling in the floors of our building if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there but we're going to now leave the elevation view and we can start to set up our floor slabs going back to the ground floor under the architecture tab you've got floor and there's a little drop down menu here as well you've got architectural floors structural floors floor by face floor slab edge we're doing an architectural floor that's all we need we don't need to do a structural floor we're not a structural designer we're just doing the architectural floor you can see that it comes up with a generic 150 millimeter floor what does this mean well let's find out what we can actually do is go to edit type and this is going to edit that floor type so what this is showing us if i can enlarge this the system family is a floor you can't change that there's nothing there to be able to change it it's a floor type alright and if we click on this button here there are different types of floors we've got a concrete floor with a 50 millimeter deck we've got a beam and a block which is 200 millimeters thick we've got concrete which is commercial 362 millimeters thick all these different types what we've selected is the generic 150 mil what does this actually mean well this is where you change the type properties of a floor or anything really you click edit type this screen comes up now you've got all of these parameters you can change by changing all their values in this sense if we wanted to make this 200 mils thick we can't actually click on just the thickness it won't let us change that what we have to do is edit the structure by clicking here this looks a bit intimidating but really what it's saying is that there is one main layer which is being sandwiched by two core boundaries so the middle layer is the structure this is what's holding it together and at the moment all it is is just a generic thickness of 150 mils there is no material assigned to this floor type but if you did want to add a material to it say if we wanted to make the inner structure a timber post or something like that,0.0-150.879,457,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=0.0s
17,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,we can click on this little button there you can't see it pop up until you hover over it there's three dots click on that now you've got the material browser i can't i cannot talk now you've got material browser and if you type in here timber you can see that there will be some kind of timber that comes up well let's just select the timber click ok that is now going to be timber instead of a generic structure and then if we wanted to make this you know the thickness of a proper timber stud that's generally 90 mils it can be 120 meals it can be 150 mils it could really be anything you want generally in residential projects it's 90 mils and so we can change your thickness to be 90. we click ok now you can see that the thickness is 90 mils but if we go back into structure we can actually add some more stuff to this at the moment it's just a timber stud what if we want plasterboard lined onto the stud like in residential construction you can add a new row to this table by clicking insert if you want this to be on the outside of your floor then you can move it up outside the core boundary which is this layer here otherwise if you want something to be aligned on the underside what you can do is insert another row and throw this down twice below the core boundary at the moment these have no thicknesses so let's say we wanted to add a passboard we click the three dots there under materials and we type in plasterboard we've got gypsum wall board which is plasterboard we can then change the thickness of this to 10 mils which is generally what the thickness of plasterboard is again just the guideline let's say on the bottom of it we wanted some kind of in concrete on the bottom which is 60 mils thick we change the thickness here to 60 mils make that concrete if we type in concrete there should be some kind of concrete we'll just use a cast in situ now we click ok what it's saying is that there's gypsum wall board on the top of this floor in the middle of the floor there's a timber stud and then underneath that timber stud there's concrete which is 60 mils thick so what we've just done is edit this edited the assembly to create a composition of materials which we can then use in the project as a floor so if we click ok and we apply those changes and we click,148.56-299.199,450,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=148.56s
18,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,ok again the generic 150 millimeter floor is no longer a generic 150 millimeter floor that there's 10 millimeters plasterboard on top then there's a timber stud then there's 60 mls of concrete now we're obviously not going to use this for our floor this was just some random stuff we made up in our case there's probably going to be a concrete slab and then we can look at the photos to see what material is on the floor so i'm going to speed through these photos to then find the entrance and we're going to create the entrance slab first so here it is you can see that there's timber there's some timber floorboards in the front entry if we create a floor type we can edit this floor type i'm actually going to revert this back to how it was this was 150 mils that was not there i'm going to delete that i'm going to delete that and then change this back to something generic i don't know if that's going to come up okay default that's fine we're going to apply that click ok you can see that reverts back to just being a generic 150ml floor first we're going to have a look at if there's actually you know this floor type already in revit and you can see there's a standard timber wood finish this might actually be what we're looking for so if we click on that and we click edit type so we can actually see what it involves we can see that it's 241 millimeters thick if we edit the structure there's an oak flooring which is 19 millimeters thick and then there's a wood sheathing chipboard actually below the oak flooring which is then on top of a timber joist rafter structure and so in our case we want a concrete slab that's not going to work for us we're going to have to create our own floor type to do that let's duplicate one of these already and since this one has oak flooring on top we're going to just duplicate this and we're going to call this oak floor on slab click ok we're going to edit the structure now and the oak flooring can stay that's fine you can see that it's finished too by changing this i should have mentioned this earlier you can change this to be either structural or you can change it to be a finish the finished two is on top of the slab finish one is underneath the slab you can make it a thermal or air layer generally you're just going to have structure and then the finishes so we're going to make this finish too we're going to change the structure we're going to delete this one and we're,297.68-447.68,471,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=297.68s
19,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,going to change the 200mm structure to be concrete by typing concrete we're going to make it it's not really what i wanted but we can use concrete in situ that's fine the thickness of the slab is actually going to be 300 millimeters thick and then we're going to have a 20 mil oak flooring on top so we're going to change the thickness here to 20 mils i'm going to click ok now we can click ok again we can see that's 320 mils thick pretty thick floor slab but three story building we're probably going to need that going to click ok now generally you'll have consultants and structural specialists that will tell you what structure is already there they'll tell you that the floor slab is da da da da da you don't have to figure that out for yourself but in this case we're just having some fun we're just modeling up kind of figuring it out for ourselves so we've got an oh floor on slab now if we go to the front entrance which is actually here there's the front porch as you can see that's the front porch there this is this uh this part we need to model in since we've already got this up we've got the oak floor on there we can then draw in our floor slab to do that we're going up to this top panel here which is the modifier tab this comes up whenever you have something selected what we're going to do is use the line tool to draw out the shape of our floor slab for us that is just going to be marking it in using the floor plan as a reference so from the outside of the building we're going to draw in a floor slab and that's going to go to this far wall here and then go down to where the stairs begin now we're just going to draw around here going to link it up and then you can see there's a bit of a gap there a little trick what you can do is use the extend tool which is this little button here or you can click tr it's the trim or extend tool what you want to do is select the item that you want to trim or extend to and then you want to click on the item that you can extend then it extends it to the thing you first clicked on pretty genius alrighty there are these pink lines that indicate where the slab is going to go it's not made yet what you have to do is click either the x or the green tick for us we want to finish the edit mode we want to accept this this floor slab it looks pretty good now before you click the green tick you want to make sure that your properties are set up as you can see this is our properties tab you you've got the right floor selected that's good if you want to change it you can just click on this drop down menu and you can,446.24-595.839,529,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=446.24s
20,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,change to any of the other floors that you want but the oak floor on slab is what we've just created we're going to use that now the level this is important what level is your slap going to sit on for us it's going on the ground floor at zero so that's fine you can actually offset it off of that level if we wanted it 200 millimeters above ground level or below ground level we could do that we're not going to change that what phase is this created in for phasing this is existing we are not doing any new construction we're going to change the phase created to existing for the phase demolished we're not demolishing it not yet anyways so we're going to click none room bounding is an option that we can talk about later just click keep that as as it is default and now we can click the green tick as we're happy with all of these and if you want you can double check some of these other things they don't really matter click the green tick as you can see there is now a slab that has been created we have just modded in our first piece of the building how exciting is that if we want to look at this in the elevation view click on that slab there oh no where's it gone well it looks like it's pretty far off from where our levels are set up that is fine we can change all this later it's not a big deal let's continue to create the floor slab so next up we've got the lounge area which branches off from the entrance that is this area here you can see that there's a stone tile kind of really quite nice flooring there and we're going to model that in to do that let's go back to revit and we're going to click on the floor and then we're going to use the rectangle tool this time because the shape is rectangular all we need to do is go from the outside and we're going to just draw the shape of this floor and we're going to go to the inside because i don't think it crosses over into this door we can double check that later if we need i'm going to just adjust this a little bit um if we want we can nudge these with the arrow keys just to push them out a little bit or push them in a little bit and then got to make sure they're all lined up nicely by zooming in panning around move this one out a little bit and as you can see this doesn't line up with the slab that we've just created before i'm going to use the align tool which you can go up here in the modify tab,595.12-746.16,485,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=595.12s
21,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,and that's this tool or you can click a l and that selects the align tool what this will allow you to do is align this line to the slab and to do that just like the trim and extend tool you want to click what you want to align to first so i want to align to the edge of this slab i'm going to click on that and as you can see there's a little blue ant line that follows that and then you can click on the pink line that you want to align to the slab i'm going to click on that boom now they're aligned you know that they're exactly in the same spot and they don't overlap perfect i'm pretty happy with how this looks i'm going to now consider changing the floor this is not an oak floor on a slab this is actually a stone floor which is probably also on a slab so i'm going to change this by going to edit type i'm going to duplicate this because we don't want to change the family we made before because any changes we make to this will change the floor slab we made earlier so we're going to duplicate it always a good habit always duplicate anything before changing it i'm going to call this a stone floor or since it's already a floor type we can just call it stone we're going to now edit the structure we're going to keep that as concrete actually we're going to make this 200 and then we're going to have a 120 thick stone and i'm just going to double check that i don't think i can see if this lines up with the other floor which is fine we're just going to make sure that they're the same we're going to keep them both at 320 mils and we're going to change the oak flooring to now be a stone let's see if we can find a good looking stone and there's not really anything there well we can either add in a new material or we can copy one and create a new one let's create a new material after we've renamed our stone we can go to the appearance tab and add an image to the generic information at the moment we don't have a stone texture we can use so you can go ahead and type into google seamless stone texture we're going to click on images and we're going to try and find a stone texture that matches or is close to what we've got here if you're watching this on the website lucky you i've already downloaded all of the textures you need for this project so you can go ahead and go to the project files and add in the textures that you want so now all you have to do is go find your stone floor i'm going to open that up and boom we've,744.079-895.279,500,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=744.079s

23,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,there are no images of that bedroom so what are we going to do we're going to assume that it is carpet and because say if we were doing an extension of this project and we're not touching this room it's not going to matter what it's modeled up as as long as it's got the walls in there etc but we're going to create a new floor here which is a slab with carpet on top so we're going to go to architecture floor and then we're going to create a new type for all the bedrooms which is going to be a carpet we're going to duplicate the stone and call this carpet we're going to edit the structure we're going to change the finish to carpet and again if there's nothing there you will have to download a carpet texture which is what you can go ahead and do and go download a texture or if you're on the website download the project files and it will be there if we right click this we can go remove image click it again and we can browse for our carpet add that in we also might want to check the scale of that to me that looks fine but as you can see it's 304 mils if that doesn't match your material that you've downloaded you might have to change that apply that click ok like 50 000 times and we are back in here with our floor carpet set up again check your phasing it's on existing check that it's going on the ground floor which it is not offset let's draw in the carpet which is going to be from the outside of these walls and then we're going to snap it onto those two points it's going to make up this entire space but as you can see there is a bathroom there so what we're going to do is use the normal line tool and we're going to just draw around the bathroom so that this slab doesn't go inside the bathroom because there's not carpet in the bathroom that would not make sense there are probably tyres in there we're going to go across and close this up about there we're going to click escape once twice then we're going to trim and extend this wall or this purple line by clicking tr what we want to trim to we want to trim to there we're going to click on that button obviously it's the wrong way around so we're going to do that again by going ctrl z we're going to click on there and click on this side and that trims it to that point sometimes you got to do that just to you know make sure you're sane going to click on this button then that button trims that point we're good to go if you're happy with all that you can now click the green tick wonderful we've got carpet in the bedroom,1041.52-1193.84,504,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1041.52s
24,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,we've got stone in the in the games room and then at the entry we've got a oak flooring now we want to add in some tyres here we're going to click on floor we're going to see if there is any tiles which um doesn't look like there is edit the type and we're then going to add in the tiles i'm not going to show you how to do this because i think you've been shown enough times now again by just looking back at my reference images i'm going to have a look and see if there's any there we go there's tiles in the bathroom there are some hit that is a hideous bathroom i'm glad that was my parents bathroom not mine but we're gonna find some textures that look like that which are also in the project files and i'm going to add that to my structure okay so now you can see that this type these tiles have a uh have a texture on it how do we do that if we go to the edit type we look at the structure we look at the bathroom tiles in the material and we look at the pattern of the foreground you can see it as a 600 by 600 tile our tiles are not 600 by 600 they are more like 100 by 200 at the you know not even if we duplicate this by clicking on the duplicate icon here i think that's what that is we can go 100 by 200 as the name and we can change this line spacing to be 100 and 200. that looks like our tiles we click ok we've now got 100 by 200 tiles click apply click ok click ok click ok there we go and that's probably even too too small but we're just going to leave it so if we want to change the timber to have a slat direction what we can do is look at which way the slats are going in the drawings here in the photos sorry i should say and they are running long ways away from the entrance going this way so if we edit this type which is the oak floor on slab we click edit structure and we edit the oak flooring what we can do is look at the surface pattern it has none we click on that we can try and find a horizontal lines this 1.5 mil might work pretty well we click ok see what that looks like we'll apply it and that looks pretty good as you can see down there click ok click ok click ok and then we've got our timber slat direction again if we add some stone work in this type we can edit the type edit,1190.4-1341.12,472,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1190.4s
25,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,the structure edit the stone edit the uh what was it the graphics then we go to the surface pattern in the foreground and we can try and find a stone but there's probably not a stone so what we can do is have a look for a stone it doesn't look like there's anything that looks like stone we're going to create a new one what would be how to do is actually import a hatch type for this pattern and to do that you can go on a lot of different websites if you just type on google stone hatch revit it'll come up with thousands of them i've gone ahead and downloaded one for you download that use it click on custom and then we're going to browse for it and again this is going to be available in your pack so let's make sure we change the import scale as at the moment we cannot see it in the preview we're going to just have to take a guess and either go bigger or smaller it looks like we're going to have to go smaller um maybe 0.3.02 that looks pretty good let's click ok make sure you turn off use render appearance and we want to change the color of this to white click ok apply this click ok click ok click ok and there we have it we've got a stone texture and again we can play around with rotating this if we wanted to but at the moment that looks pretty good we've got some timber slats we've got some tiles then we've got some stone work which represents this stone all right if we go into our 3d view you can also see that these have applied in our 3d view as well it's not just on the drafting views so that's pretty cool so now we're going to have to create some of these levels which are on the floor above as you can see there are stairs going up here and then this is level two or level one i think we've named it as if we go to our east elevation we can see that that is level 1 which is 1400 above the ground level we go back to the ground floor what we can actually do is start to draw these in we can click on the floor but we're going to change the level to level 1. we can see that there is carpet in the study and that is also in the bedrooms as well that same carpet and that's all on level one so there's the study these are the bedrooms they're all carpet and then you've got a bathroom here which are using tiles so let's go ahead and use the carpet that we've already set up and we can draw in these slabs now what we can actually do is draw these in for all of the bedrooms at once we don't have to do a separate slab for each one,1340.159-1490.3200000000002,509,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1340.159s
26,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,so let's just draw around these walls here and we want to close it off before the bathroom this carpet also runs through the hallway from what i remember so we're going to just draw around the study as well we're going to make sure we align it up to the other slab as well so we don't get overlapping lines we're going to go all the way to the stairs draw around and then link up again now to make sure that we've aligned these let's use the align tool by pressing a l click the object or the line we want to align to and then click the line that we want to align that's hard to say i'm going to just make sure that this pink line is also on that one and we can also nudge some of these if we want i might just nudge that one forward a bit nudge that one out not just one down that looks pretty good nudge that one in cool so now that we're happy with our floor slab we can click the green tick after making sure that it's on the correct phasing which it is it's existing it's on the right level now if we click the grain tick our carpet shouldn't have that texture but it does so we'll have to play around with that and then if we go to the 3d view you can now see that this slab is slightly higher than the slab down below and there are going to be stairs that come up here to this platform let's also model in the floor for the bathroom this can just be a rectangle using the tiles that we've already already created and so this is going to use the same tile type as we used in the bathroom downstairs we're going to make sure that's all snapped on which we use the rectangle tool for and click the green tick there we have it there's the bathroom in there's all the bedrooms in and the study now we've just got one more level which is this upper floor we know that the kitchen is a timber slatted board and then the stairs up here i'm going to guess that's a carpet but it's probably carpet on top of timber floor as well so i'm just going to do this entire section on the upper floor as timber all of this as timber go ahead and create another floor this time we're going to change the level to be level two gonna make sure all of those are okay which they are and then we can just draw around these lines and we don't want to draw around the stairs as that's going to be an opening where the stairs are as you can see there's obviously no floor coming across here that's all an,1488.64-1637.84,484,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1488.64s
27,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,opening so we're going to start it up back here again we're going to just nudge these out a bit so our slab goes to the outside of the wall make sure that this isn't on tiles we can change this to the oak floor on slab and now we click the green tick where's it gone well as we are on the ground floor plan we can't see it because it's on two levels above it is above the cut line for floor plans if you don't know what i mean by that i have a video explaining general floor plan terms and how floor plans work i suggest checking that out but that should make sense to you if it does not check out that video as you can see our third floor is now over to the side here now obviously the third floor doesn't sit out all that way if we can have a look at out here the third floor is sitting pretty well directly above the ground level you can see that the balcony just overhangs past the the games room down the bottom which is this room here so let's try and find where our slab has gone so we can uh move it over so if we go to the level two floor plan which was automatically created when we created that level for level two we can see our floor plan here but we cannot see anything else and that's again because of the cut line if we change the view range on this we will then be able to see what's below it or what we can do is create a base level underlay if we create the underlay to be the ground floor we will be able to see the ground floor below it although we cannot edit any of the ground floor it is just showing it now we can lock this on to where we think it would go so we can use the move tool or press mv and we can pick a point and start to move it and we're just going to have a play around and see where we think this would go i'm going to have a look back at the ground floor so we can see this so the balcony is over overhanging around here we haven't modeled that in yet this should line up with that wall there as you can see there are stairs so let's go ahead and do that use the move tool we should be able to lock it on to that line there i think that's going to be pretty well perfect you can see that the balcony overhangs past the game's room and that's what's happening there this wall is flush with this wall as you can see what is happening here and if we go back to our level two view that is exactly what's happening the balcony will come out across here for the sake of not moving this reference,1635.6-1788.0800000000002,508,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1635.6s
28,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,file around later let's just model in these now so we've got the carport we've got the porch and then we've also got this balcony that we need a model in let's go ahead and create another floor this is going to be on the ground floor where the carport and the porch is we're going to just use a in-situ concrete which is 225 millimeters thick make sure it's on the ground floor and let's just model this one in we can make sure they're snapped up a bit later if we need to so that stone floor actually is the same for the entrance sec for the front porch as it is in the game's room so i'm actually going to create that as the same slab i think that makes sense so let's delete what we've done there this porch here is going to be the exact same as that so let's just get out of this and all we have to do is now edit this to over extend into the porch you can do that by clicking edit boundary and then using the line tool again we can draw around the porch and then we're just going to have to bring this line back because if we don't bring it back and if i undo that and we try and click the tick it's not going to let us have overlapping lines the slab needs to be a continuous closed shape and it can't have you know one slab here one slab over here they have to be connected so if we continue we can bring this line back and now we've got a continuous line that creates a closed shape let's click the green tick now that slab moves out over to the porch the carport i'm going to guess is again something different and that is a brick so let's go ahead and model that in with bricks going to click floor try and find a brick floor i don't think there's going to be one so we're going to have to create one again but first let's uh use the in-situ concrete again and we're going to edit the type of this we're going to duplicate it always make sure you duplicate it we're going to call this brick floor click ok change the structure of this and as you can see there's already some structure there's now a membrane layer as well which is damp proofing this is you know handy for us but it's not essential for a student project if we move this up we can now create a material for it and we're going to try and find a brick hopefully there is a brick there we go now masonry brown brick that,1787.279-1937.919,465,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1787.279s
29,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,pattern looks fine for us we can change the thickness to 90. going to click okay again now let's model this in click the green tick it's on the ground floor that looks pretty good that matches that yep perfect now finally all we have to do is model in this balcony and this might be a bit difficult now that we've moved this floor slab already so what i'm actually going to do is copy this reference layer over to my other drawing and what i'm what i could do is just ctrl c to copy or i'm going to click copy to clipboard and this is going to make it a bit easier and allow you to line it up to your other drawing so we're going to go to the level 2 floor plan and if you've closed that you can access that in the project browser i'm going to now click on an object it doesn't matter what i click on i'm going to click paste aligned to current view and now we just want to move this over so that this slab here lines up with the slab in the reference image i'm going to click mv or the move button there i'm going to click the corner of it and move that to there now we can see where the balcony goes and we can start to model this in as well so creating another floor we're going to make sure it's on level two we're going to have a look at what floor they use for the balcony which i cannot remember it doesn't look too thick it looks maybe 100 mils thick at most there it is it looks like it's just the painted concrete so we're going to just use the concrete slab and as you can see there should be a incitry concrete slab that we can use so again we're just going to model around this from the start of the stairs we're going to make sure that this is all lined up nice and neatly by using the align tool again press a l or press the align tool up here click the click the line we want to align to and then click the line that we want to align hard to say i'm going to do that again actually that looks fine for the moment in fact that slab might just be overhanging there might be a bit of a gap between the slab below so what i'm actually going to do is move this out and then snap it onto that line and we can then move the other slab later as well so there's no gap and again the game's room below is this outline here and this doesn't quite line up so i'm going to bring back that line and we're going to snap to it with the other slab as well,1936.0-2091.2,489,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=1936.0s
30,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 2 - Floors,finish that one and you can see that the highlighted floors overlap that's fine because we're now going to edit this other slab and make sure it's all neatly snapped up all right and then it was down the bottom here as well we're just going to snap this onto there now there should be no overlapping slabs that looks really good let's have a look at our 3d view i know there's a mistake i've already made but let's have a look at it there we have it we've got the ground floor there's a carport there the porch is below it this level above sits directly above that slab there's the balcony except this is the bathroom it's on the wrong level what are we going to do as you can see it's underneath the level it needs to be on what we can do is select that floor and you can just change the level now there's always a way to change it afterwards and um it's not the end of the world if you don't set stuff on the right levels because you can come back and change it and so then we've got the ground floor level one floor level two floor in the next lesson we'll be adding in the stairs and railings if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there,2089.04-2179.92,261,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s,https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9sI1yVP99s&t=2089.04s
31,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,welcome to part three of the beginner's revit course we'll be adding in the stairs and railings if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there by clicking on the reference image i'm going to bring this image to the foreground instead of the background so that we can see underneath it to do that this button up here or we can check change the draw layer i like using this one we're going to change it to the foreground now we can see everything as we can see there's a few stairs that we haven't modeled in yet and it's probably going to be best to do that before the walls just so that we don't have to move around any walls or floors later because we might indeed have to change the floor levels according to how the steps work if we go to the 3d view we can see where the stairs are going to go there's some stairs leading up here and then those stairs lead around up to level two so this is the stairwell bit in the middle let's go back to the ground floor plan and start to model these in again using the architecture tab we're going to click on the circulation stair button now there's a few ways to model upstairs the easiest way we're going to do if we've just got a straight landing like this a straight run i should say then we can just create a run and this creates a run of stairs by specifying points it automatically creates landings for you very simple all we have to do is just change some settings in this side here we're going to keep the 190 millimeters in 250 millimeter goings each stair has a 190 millimeter riser it goes up 190 meters whereas they have a width of 250 millimeters so they go up 190 across 250. so the base level for the stairs is obviously the ground floor there is no base offset that's fine the top level is level one that's cool as you can see the desired stair height is 1400 and that is you know up to level one the run width we're going to have to figure this out by pressing on the measure tool and then we can find what's the width from this point to that point where it locks on so we want a width of not quite 2540 because there are two stairs here we're going to go to the midpoint and that's about 1200 you always want to make sure that the dimensions are snapped onto an even number which is easy to use you don't want to make this,0.08-153.51899999999998,485,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=0.08s
32,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,1198.8 because when they're building this that's not going to be very easy to do so we're going to make it 1200 for the stair width again click the run button and we can change this to 1200 and we want an automatic landing as well now all we have to do is click on one point and it can tell you it will tell you how many rises are created and how many you have remaining so they are going to need eight risers to be able to get to the top of this level and as you can see that actually doesn't quite line up with the floor plan in fact this only really needs six rises therefore we said that there were going to be seven steps at 200 millimeters wide but we've got a 250 millimeter going so that doesn't exactly line up so now let's just create a stair that's 190 millimeters going up and 200 across because then we should have seven stairs that clear this entire distance again we're going to edit the type of the stairs we're going to duplicate this so that we don't change that existing stair that we've got there and we're going to make this a 190 millimeter max riser and a 200 millimeter max going and then all we have to do is change the tread depth to 200 millimeters click okay now if we recreate a stair it's going to have 200 millimeters in width as you can see there there we go we've got eight risers like we wanted and that just about covers that distance i'm going to place that in and you can't see it because this reference layer is still on the foreground i'm going to bring that to the background in a second i'm just going to click the finish edit mode bring that to the background and there are our stairs going up to the level above again we can just nudge this to make sure that it's in the right spot or better practice is to use the align tool click what we want to align to click what we want aligned and that's not quite what we wanted click that one click the edge of the railing if we go to a 3d view we can now see that our stairs are modelled in and it's got a nice railing on it as well these railings are automatically generated when you do a stair now we're just going to make sure that this lines up with our reference images and let's try and find a picture of the stairs which we actually don't have from what i remember so not quite but we do have this image here which shows that there is going to be a railing that goes from the top of the top level down to the bottom level,152.2-302.56,484,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=152.2s
33,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,and then there are no railings on the sides so if we go back into this then obviously that railing there is not necessary and that railing there is not necessary as it's going to go all the way up so we're just going to go ahead and delete them now what we can do is go to the level one floor plan which is this floor plan here and model in another set of stairs that goes up to level two so if we go to the floor plan section and click on level one oh we can't see anything but that's just because it's out here what you can do is right click on the screen and go zoom it to fit and then it will show you everything that's on your workspace so let's zoom in here and we can start to draw in the stair again we're going to go to the architecture tab we're going to go to stairs and then we're going to draw another run at 1200 going up from level 1 to level 2 and this is showing new construction because this is a different floor plan in fact let's get out of this and let's change this to existing so that way we don't have to change it again later that's why that's no longer showing as black and again let's go back to create another stair level one to level two we've got the 200 millimeter going this time again 1200 let's draw this in last time we created the stair from the center line which wasn't very accurate instead what we can do is change this to be aligned to the left or to the right depending on which side you want and we can click on that corner of that stair there and just bring this up and that's going to generate the same set of stairs going the opposite way if we go to our 3d view this should look pretty good not bad at all let's place that one in it's going to put in the railings which we don't need however we do need a railing on this side so we can come back to that a bit later so now while we're on this topic of stairs we can actually go ahead and put in the balcony stairs as well which are going to go up to this point here which is the balcony which comes from the ground floor if we go to the ground floor plan you can see that the stairs start here looking at our reference image again click stairs make sure you save your project i love that rivet automatically asks you to save your projects because a lot of the time we don't save and then we lose a lot of work if our computer crashes so now we want to go from the ground floor up to level two and to do that all we have to do is change the top level to level two and apply that now you can see the desired stair height is 2 800 above the ground floor good that is great,301.12-452.96,531,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=301.12s
34,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,we're going to change the goings oh actually we're going to keep the goings from 200 millimeters the width let's find out what the width is going to be measure from one side to the other this is actually a lot wider these are 1500 millimeter stairs let's change the width to be 1500 mils we're going to change the location line instead of being to the left as you can see you can't really lock onto anything we swap that to the right now we can click on this point here and draw across and create that stairs let's have a look if that actually did what we wanted it to do so here are the stairs and it looks like they just don't quite line up we therefore need to change the height of the rises and we might need to change the height of the goings as well if we look at our reference image let's see if we can find how many steps there are there aren't any really good photos of the stairs but we can try and just figure out how many there are by counting them so i can guess that there'd be 1 2 3 4 5 6 16 17 18 steps so we've got 18 stairs and there's a there's a um there's a height difference of 2800 let's figure out what 2800 divided by what we say 18 is so that's 155. so if there's 18 steps each riser is going to go up 155 millimeters let's change that by changing the stairs make sure you duplicate it we're going to change this to 155 millimeter max riser i'm just going to go ahead and click ok and change the riser height to 156 and click ok as you can see this still doesn't help with the fact that there's not enough distance so we obviously then need to figure out what the width of each step is going to be let's go to the level 2 floor plan actually because this is where we've got the overlay and now we can measure the distance from the top of the balcony or the bottom of the balcony i guess you could say to the bottom of the ground let's measure from this point to that point which is 3300 we're going to have to take a guess at what the stair width is i'm going to guess it's about 180 mils so if we go 3 300 divided by 180 we can figure out how many steps we need and that's 18.3 now 18.3 is a pretty weird number,450.72-601.36,439,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=450.72s
35,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,so instead of doing that we're going to now adjust that number to be 18 steps whoops 18 steps because this is just an existing stair set it's not going to be perfect if this was a new construction you would know the riser and going of each stair but we don't so again i'm going to edit this type we've got 156 there now we're going to make this 180 and in fact let's change this back to 155 because it doesn't have to be perfect we've got a 150 we're going to rename this 155 millimeter max riser and 180 millimeter going click ok click apply and then we're given this error oh it's a warning actually the actual riser height of stair is greater than the maximum riser height specified in the stair type if we click ok that should be fine um that's going to be something else in these parameters that's saying that the maximum height is going to still be probably 200 millimeters but we're just going to click ok and this should be fine let's delete this stair that we've placed in create a new run going from ground floor to level two we're going to go back to the ground floor plan and then we can see we can create this staircase and if we go to our 3d view that should line up pretty well nicely we might have to adjust this just a little bit and to do that let's go to the level 2 floor plan and we're going to want to align this to that plane there press a l click that line we want to align to click the edge of the stairs as you can see the railing is currently inside the wall but if we look at the image here there is no railing on that side of the wall anyway so we can do not worry about that as we would delete it let's click the green tick and see what this looks like go to our 3d view not bad not bad that looks pretty damn good to me if we rotate around this you can see that it's a little bit wider than what the balcony actually is so i've got a feeling these stairs aren't actually 1500 millimeters wide the real estate plan would have just not been 100 correct yep as you can see it's showing stairs up there to be really wide but then here it's quite thin let's actually just measure what this distance is and that's probably more realistic realistically what the width is and i'm going to guess it's about 650 millimeters wide which isn't that wide when you think about it in fact if we get our tape measure out 650 it's about that wide,599.279-749.279,470,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=599.279s
36,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 3 - Stairs,so we had to run downstairs with that wide does that look right to me that doesn't really look right but we're going to do it anyways at 650. so now i'm going to delete this stair set again and we're going to create this again at 650 mils as the actual run width instead of 1500 because that's way too big make sure again this goes up to level two and now we can draw this in and this is going to look a bit better let's make sure we nudge it again back on our level two floor plan i'm gonna click a l to align it align it to there we're going to align it to the slab as well let's have a look in our 3d view that looks pretty good but again it's still not quite the right width and i've got a feeling this width of the slab is off in the photos you can see there's actually quite a larger overhang over that area below so my guess is that i'm going to move this slab out to match the staircase but for the moment that looks really good we've got some stairs in from the ground floor there's no railing on this side i'm going to delete that we can keep that railing in for now but let's edit this slab to make sure that it lines up with the stairs so one way to do that let's go to our level two floor plan click the align tool go to a line from that end to that end click the green tick go back to our 3d view there we have it alrighty so that stairs down that slab's done let's put in some walls in the next lesson we'll be adding in the wolves with custom wool types and materials if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there you,749.68-872.6389999999999,353,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8h20FUxwc&t=749.68s
37,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,welcome to part four of the revit beginners course we'll be adding in the wolves with custom rule types and materials if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there i'm going to start in my ground floor plan view what we've got in the architecture tab is a wool icon button this is what we've used previously i think you're pretty familiar with this now if we click on the wall it brings up our properties for that wall which we can change according to what we want to create so what we want to create is a brick wall around the ground floor but first let's have a look at what this looks like in the photos so where is the ground floor as you can see on the back side of the house you've got bricks coming around here bricks around this side to the game's room as well where there's some large windows as well which we will do a bit later we'll get into some windows there are bricks everywhere and there's a lot of bricks but there's a bit of a plinth on the bottom as well looks like the bricks also come around to the side here i'm guessing the whole house is just brick and from what we can see from the interior photos is that there's um a plasterboard lining uh pretty much everywhere in the house plasterboard finish which has been painted and looks like pretty much all we're going to be doing here we've got some tiles in the bathroom we can do that as well uh there are bricks in the hallway that are painted white so this is a double brick veneer then there are also this side is also double brick veneer on the ground floor that separating wall is double brick veneer the entrance is double brick veneer looks like yeah bedrooms are all plasterboard lined some of the entrance in the games room and stuff like that is double brick upstairs in the kitchen is brick on the outside plasterboard on the inside and then the bathrooms have some titles as you can see there's already a wall type that is double brick and it's 270 millimeters thick if we have a look at the reference image we can see what the wall thicknesses are just by measuring off of it because it is to scale so i'm going to bring this to the foreground and we can measure off some of these walls i'm going to press the measure button and let's just measure from one side to the other so it looks like it's about there to there this wall here is about 230 wide,0.0-151.68,486,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=0.0s
38,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,that wall type there is obviously then going to be just a single brick on the outside which is 110 thick and then there will be like a 90 millimeter maybe wool stud so it's probably timber framed um and then there will be a maybe 10 mil lining on the inside of the wall as well so what does that add up to if we go 110 plus 90 plus 10 that's about 210 which is about what that is otherwise if we have a look in our our wall types there might already be a single brick there we go 230 there's a brick wall and this if we look at the structure shows that it's just a 230 millimeter uh thick brick what we could do if we wanted to we could insert another one in here another row move that up and here you can see it says exterior side so this is going to be the brick on the outside so then instead what we can do is make this the masonry brick and this can be 110 millimeters thick the structure is actually going to be a timber stud which is 90 millimeters thick so if we look for timber we could actually make this maybe what does this look like no image we're going to use just the timber we're going to change this to 90 and there'd also be some air barriers and stuff like that which make up a little bit more thickness but for the sake of this let's just create another another one which is the the plasterboard on the interior and we can change this to gypsum and this is going to be 30 millimeters thick so then that makes up 230 and we're going to click ok so now our basic brick wall has plasterboard on the interior and brick on the veneer on the outside in fact let's change this we're going to rename it to show that 230 brick veneer plasterboard lining now we've got the brick veneer wool but what about some of those double brick walls as you can see this wall here looks a little bit thicker this is where it was double brick whereas in these drawings i feel like these aren't shown at the correct dimensions because the double brick wall is obviously going to be thicker than a plasterboard lined interior wool so i feel like the these real estate plans they're not always 100 correct that's fine what we're using it for that's fine i'm going to just create another wall though which is double brick veneer but in this sense there is a double brick veneer already there let's have a look at what this looks like if we edit the structure you can see that there's masonry on the outside,149.76-302.56,474,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=149.76s
39,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,and masonry is a structure which is fine there's an air filtration barrier of 50 between the two masonry bricks which allows condensation and water to flow through that kind of stuff i'm gonna click okay that is fine the double brick wall is what we will use for double brick now how about some of these other interior walls these are a lot thinner and my guess is that they're going to be they're showing about 140 i'm guessing they're about 120 thick it's kind of hard to tell with these but we're going to do is we'll say 150 just to make just to play it safe just so it's an easy number as well so if there are 150 millimeter thick my guess is that there's a 90 millimeter stud or perhaps even a 120 millimeter timber stud with then plasterboard lined on the outside and the inside so let's create a wall type that shows that otherwise there might already be one here there's not but we can also see that there is a timber stud already in there if we edit this and duplicate that and use it as a um a template we can create a let's say timber stud blaster board lined in out we're going to click edit and then we can insert two more rows add one up add the other one down below onto the interior side one onto the exterior side and let's change these from structure to finish one and then this one to finish two change the material we're gonna want gypsum otherwise just plasterboard uh depending what revit version you're using in australia they call it gypsum and we're going to give this a thickness of let's say 15 and 15 so then you've got a 120 millimeter thick wall that should be fine so now we've got a double brick wall we've got a brick veneer wall which is a timber stud lined by a masonry wall i guess you could say and then we've got a timber stud wall lined with plasterboard for the interiors and that should be all the wall types we need so let's start creating walls for this we're going to want to use the floor slabs that we've already created and so we're going to want to put this reference image although we're going to still want to use it we want to see the floor slabs underneath so that we can lock onto them and rather than going between background and foreground to be able to see between the two what you can do is change the opacity of this however what this would require doing is getting into photoshop turning down the opacity on this and then bringing it in because if we go,300.16-452.08,467,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=300.16s
40,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,to override the graphics in view by the element we cannot actually change the transparency like you could with other items for this sake i'm not going to do that we're going to change this to the background instead we're going to change the opacity of all of these slabs so i'm just going to select everything and we don't want to change the opacity of the stairs so what i'm going to do is go to the filter button up here and this is to filter the selection that you've made so now all we want to um have selected are the floors we don't want to select any of the stair paths or the stairs or the runs we're going to click none we're just going to do floors click ok now only the floors are selected they've been filtered out and so to change the opacity of this what you can do is right click one of the floors and change the override graphics in the view we're going to do this by element so by doing it by element it's changing it for each one that you've selected rather than doing the entire category i'll show you what i mean by that so i can change the surface transparency here if we make this to 70 you're going to be able to see through those slabs however if we cancel out of this and we want to change just one of these i can right click it go to the override graphics and view and do it by element now you can change the opacity of just one of these items instead of all of them so what happens if you want to change the opacity for every single floor in your model if you right click one of these and go to the override graphics and view and go to by category now you're going to be changing every single floor when you make these changes if we apply a 60 transparency to it it's changed all of the flaws that's much easier than having to filter through all of the flaws and so now we've got the outlines of our floors and we can see through them to see where all of the windows and the doors are and where where the walls are let's go to the architecture tab and click on walls we're first going to do the entrance which has the double brick wall on this side and then this double brick comes around all of the ground floor which i'm assuming all of this here is going to be double brick if we select our wall type to be the devil brick we want to change some of these settings the base constraint this is where the wall is going to be sitting we want this to be on the ground floor level that we've set up and what this is referencing is in our elevation view the ground floor we then want the top constraint to go up to the level above as we can see in,449.28-600.72,518,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=449.28s
41,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,the images of the games room these walls only go up to level one they don't continue up the whole way like some of these other walls this level here is actually level two this is the third story as there's a half level up and then there's another half level above so if we make the top constraint level two that now has an unconnected height of 2800 and it's now going to be constrained to that level now what this constraint does by constraining it to level 2 instead of just typing in a well an unconnected height of 2800 by constraining it to level two if we were to change this level to be this is level two underneath it's kind of hard to see i'm just going to hide this away if we were to change level two to b we realized that it was 400 high instead of 2 800. by changing this that level is now 3 400 high instead of 2800 that's what constraining it does it makes it a lot easier than if you come back to if you want to change something that's what bim is all about whereas if this was in autocad what you would have to do is then go back to every single floor plan every single elevation and change the heights to 3400 but this it's just by parameters you change one parameter and it changes the whole project and that's what i love about bim let's model in this double brick wall the rest of these properties look fine apart from maybe the location line by it being on the wall center line what this means is that when we place our wool it's going to be placing it on the center line of what we chose for example if i were to place it on this point here you can see that it's creating it from the center line of that line but we want it to be on the inside so that it follows the slab on the inside of that line and what i've also just noticed is that these slabs don't line up so this is something we're going to have to adjust as well the reason why these don't line up is because we would have made changes to the level above remember when we were making some changes to level two and so we can see that the floor below doesn't quite line up with the floor above so now we're going to have to go back to our ground floor adjust this layer to line up with those slabs we edit the boundary select on this line click a l to align it and we're just going to align to that line to that slab there we go now we know that they're flush let's create our wall for the location line we're going to be creating the interior face on the inside so if we make the finished face interior now we know that the interior face is,598.88-749.6,511,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=598.88s
42,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,going to be on the inside of this room if we go around and just draw out these walls we're not going to be looking at doors or windows we're just putting in the walls and we're going to snap it to the floor slab we can create these walls alrighty so they are going up to level two let's have a look at this in a 3d view what we just created what we can see is that those walls go up to level two you've got the bricks on the outside but what you can see is that the wolves are poking through the slab now the reason why this is happening is because these walls are constrained to level two but this slab is also constrained to level two and so there's 225 millimeters underneath that level of floor slab or in this case is whatever the thickness of this is 320 mils so these wolves we don't want to go up to the same top of the slab we want it to go to the bottom of the slab how do we do that we're going to select all four of these walls and we're going to change the top offset we want to offset these wolves from the top constraint and that is going to be using the top offset tool we want it to be 320 millimeters below that level because that's the thickness of the floor slab so if we want there to be a top offset having this as 320 is going to push the wall 320 millimeters up if we make this negative 320 that wall is then going to sit 320 millimeters below level two so let's do that we go negative 320 and hit enter there we go those walls now only go up to that floor slab instead of up to level two no more poking through and so that's the games room walls finished how about the entrance now let's do this entrance which is sitting in here let's go back to the ground floor plan and let's create some walls now with this wall here we know that this interior side is brick but then on the opposite side there's a bedroom so this is the entrance this is the wall we're talking about that side is brick towards the entrance but then on the opposite side there's a bedroom and that side is probably not going to be brick if there's a robe there that side is probably going to be plasterboard so there's going to be a the masonry on the outside then there's going to be a stud then there's going to be plasterboard so this,747.12-898.0,453,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=747.12s
43,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,is not double brick this is actually going to be the pb lined plasterboard lined brick veneer so let's go ahead and create this ball it's still set for the the finished face to be on the interior so this time we're going to want the bricks on this side and by changing the finish face to be on the exterior that will achieve that so let's draw that in and there we go what you can see is that that's done it the wrong way around the plasterboard is actually towards the entrance and the brick is towards the bedroom so we want to flip that around to do that we can select the wall and then you'll see these two little arrows here that is going to flip it around but now we need to also nudge it into place so i'm just going to move this up so i'm going to use the align tool i'm going to select this this line here because that's going to be what we're snapping to then i'm going to click the inside of the plasterboard wall which is it's probably not going to let me do that i'm going to just click the outside of it so what i'm going to do is just nudge this into place there we go that looks nice and aligned up there and now the plasterboard is on the inside where the bedroom is and the masonry is towards the entrance perfect and i've just noticed that this wall here is not quite in the right spot so we can move this over as well i'm going to use the move tool click that outside line and snap it to the um the other wall there otherwise i can just not nudge it into place which is probably the easier way to go about it now for the bedroom wall i'm going to assume because this is plasterboard lined for the for the bathroom as you can see in this image here this plasterboard on it i'm going to assume that the brick probably goes out to the bathroom like this and then the bathroom has masonry with plasterboard lining if we go to the architecture tab click on the walls make sure you save your project we select the wall type which is the brick veneer plasterboard lined this junction's a little bit weird this is where you might have to do a bit of thinking the plasterboard wall is if it's going to be flush with this double brick wall here that means that there's going to be a bit of a weird gap along this side here let me show you what i mean by that if we set this ball up you can see that there's a weird gap in then the study space so my guess is that this wall runs along through here and breaks up the double brick wall from the brick veneer wool,897.44-1048.3999999999999,497,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=897.44s
44,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,i'm just going to delete that and then this double brick wall actually goes along the study and then you've got a plasterboard lined masonry wool which is plastic plasterboarded on both sides we're going to keep the finished face on interior and we're going to draw that wall in but this is not going to be exactly what we want i'm going to align this to that wall there so that way that study wall is now flush and that's probably not brick from the photos if i remember that's a masonry wall that's been plaster boarded over by the looks of it that means this side is actually plasterboard and that would mean that this side as well is also plasterboard so how do we split this ball up then for the sake of this we're just going to keep it as is we do know that that is plasterboard on the study wall but it's also not going to be a big deal for us you already know how to change wall types and all that that sort of stuff so we're just going to continue modeling up these walls again this outside wall has brick to the outside and then plasterboard on the inside we click wall under architecture and create that same wall again if we set the finish face to exterior we can then draw in the rest of these walls and that's it for the brick veneer for the bathroom these interior walls are going to be plasterboard lined the wolves that we already created up if we have a look down here we've got the timber stud plasterboard lined inside and outside we can then draw them in and we're going to go back there and as you can see sometimes it doesn't match up as you'd like so you have to just play around with the location line if we make this the interior and then draw in some of these walls and go down there down there up to that point there and we also need a wall in here to bring up the same command that you just had open you can click enter and now you can see that i'm back on creating walls so i'm just going to place this last one in where that slab locks up and that's just going to line up with those two walls now you've got a bit of a weird junction going on there but that's more or less how it would probably be detailed it's always good to have a look at what this looks like in a 3d view to see if it's all going to plan and again you can see that these walls are going up to level two what we actually want them to do is be 320 millimeters below that level but we can come back,1045.6-1196.4,482,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=1045.6s
45,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,and adjust these all later what you can also see is that these slabs don't line up so if we go to our level 2 view and we can suss that out you can see that the slab below doesn't quite line up we can just edit that boundary align it to that slab below and there we have it what it's asking is do we want the walls to go up to attach to that floor and yes we do what that did is that it's now just attached the walls that are here to go up to that floor slab how handy is that and so now we can see that those wolves are nice and flush despite there being different types the slabs are now lined up nicely we can also double check some of these other ones if we if we wanted to they all look pretty good to me at the moment and we might come across some differences later but that's fine for now so now we're going to model in these bedroom walls if we go back to our ground floor this here is double brick from what i remember in the photos and let's put that in if we click wall change this to double brick 270 finish face exterior and that's going to just lock it to that exterior line and we're going to bring this around bob's your uncle we're going to make sure that's on to the right level going up to level 2 existing phasing that's all fine have a look at it in our 3d view we've now got those walls in for ground floor if we just have a look at what else there is to do we can see that we're missing the entrance wall as well so if we have a look at our photos the entrance from here you can see that that's all kind of just doors there's glazing and then there's just doors let's just put in a 90 millimeter thick wall just a generic wool for now so that we know that that's not just an empty space so if we go down here and we just use the stud timber or the generic 100 millimeter wall that might be a bit better just making sure that we are on the finished face interior then lock it onto the right layer and just draw that across so now we've got just a generic wall there for the time being before we put our doors and windows in for the ground floor there's also a few more things we'll need to consider what is going on in this section here at the moment not too sure i'm pretty sure the stairs might come over the top of here that are going up that would probably make sense actually let's consider that because you can see the stairs come up and there's a platform above now these stairs they look like they're in line with,1194.559-1346.0,503,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=1194.559s
46,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,the ground floor so they might actually not overhang but there is this little ceiling then above the entrance what we can also notice from these photos is that these brick walls these internal brick walls are floor to ceiling so that's a really big really big height this is probably going up to the top of the level two ceiling and we would have to figure out those ceiling heights as well what i actually remember there being is at the entrance there was a little door here that went to a like an underground basement kind of thing and i think that door just sat flush here so i think there's a wall that comes across here which was probably masonry again and then on the inside there was this underground scary basement thing that we called the whole dad's hole if we would go and play in dad's hole oh that's terrible let's not say that we did not call it that um all right so let's put in the wall there that's going to be brick veneer you know what let's do it as a double brick double brick wall i think that makes sense and we're going to go across like that and then there's going to be a door that sits in there as well and you know what if you change your mind and you said that that wasn't double brick you can still change this after you've placed it so let's say that we wanted it just to be a 110mm brick i've just changed that easy as that in fact that looks a lot nicer that is probably what i'm going to do now let's go back to our 3d view see what's going on that's looking pretty good this wall doesn't quite go all the way across there so we're going to have to play around with that what's holding up the stairs what's um in that space there again there would probably be a wall that runs across down here for the hole let's have a look at what that looks like this entrance wall here whether you've got the brick on the inside and the plasterboard on the outside i'm guessing this is going to go all the way across for the bedroom so let's just go ahead and bring that all the way across there that's going to be quite good because then you've got the stairs that come up there let's have a look at this in 3d and obviously we're going to have to adjust these stairs and so what we can see is that this slab isn't quite lined up with the ground floor so we're going to adjust this edit boundary go to level 2 and we can just snap this onto that slab,1344.24-1495.6,471,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=1344.24s
47,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,below click ok yes we want to attach the levels let's go to 3d but still we've got this wall that's coming through the stairs which probably doesn't happen in real life and so we've got some problems coming on here nothing major we do know that the stairwell does have bricks on the inside faces that go all the way up to the level two ceiling so we're going to have to change the height of these but now that's level two's problem we're gonna go on with level one and we can come back to the basement as well because that will need to be modeled in more than likely as well even though we don't have plans or drawings of it it was kind of like a hidden away place that no one really knew about just there was a door on this side here and it was a tiny door as well which you could have to like push to get open and then on the inside of that there was like crumbled in like stone work and stuff like it looks like it'd been dug and dug out by hand a weird place and it's funny that they don't have floor plans or drawings of it or as well because like maybe they just thought it was a cupboard or something so we're gonna have to model up something there as well okay so let's move on to the level one floor plan we're now gonna do the walls for level one so if we go to the level one floor plan we can go to the project browser and click on level one there we go you can see the stairs there what we might need to do as well is to overlay or bring in that reference image again so if we go to the ground floor and we select our reference image click copy to keyboard or click control c really we can go back to level one our level one floor plan and we can paste it align to the current view and again we can't see through these slabs because we now have to change the override settings for this view so if we right click on that and we override the graphics by category again we can change this for all of the floor slabs we're going to change the transparency to let's just say 70 apply that click ok now we can see through it again what we want to make sure is that since we're on a different view we want to check the phasing at the moment it's showing all the phasing and it's on the existing phase that's fine so let's go ahead and model in some of these walls we know that the study again is brick veneer on the outside plasterboard lined so let's model that in if we go to the architecture tab click on wall or you can just press wa what you can do is choose the brick veneer wall type and we can just model in these wolves we want to make sure that we go,1494.0-1645.52,527,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=1494.0s

51,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,these walls are made of as you can see in the kitchen we've got some plasterboard on the interior and then on the exterior there is brick so there's brick on the outside then you've probably got a timber stud and then you've got your plasterboard also in the living room the kitchen's just over to the right here in the living room you've also got plasterboard on the inside and the exterior is also brick that's just another one of that that's also the living room it's all looking like it is plasterboard and brick very easy we've already got that set up in our wall types so if we go to the architecture tab click on the wall we should also already have our brick veneer this is going to be the brick veneer 230 plasterboard lined we're going to want the plasterboard on the inside so that's going to be for the exterior walls let's just draw them in while we've got that fresh we're going to make the finished face the exterior we're going to line it up with the existing wall we've already drawn in there base constraints at the moment we can just change that after as you guys have seen we're just gonna go around this exterior and draw in these wolves gonna follow the slab now we're not too sure what's going on here so we're gonna have to try and figure that out i'm actually just to cancel that off there we know that there's brick here but we're not too sure what's going on across here actually we're going to draw that in so let's draw that bit in up to that point and now we've got to figure out what's going on with these interior walls first it's always good to have a look in your 3d view to see what's going on as you can see the walls we've just created are very low they are obviously not constrained to the right level so we're going to have to select all of those walls we just created by holding control i'm just selecting multiples that should be all of them and now we can figure out what level this goes to if we're looking at east elevation again we've got our levels set up the level two roof is already set up so now we can just make sure that all these walls we've got selected are constrained to the level two roof with the top constraint that is up to level two roof there we go that's much better now there are a few things we notice as we pan around this model you can see that the slab is currently cutting into this brick wall which is not what happens in the photos if we can see the photos there's obviously just one brick wall there's no slab there so let's edit that,2097.359-2248.64,487,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=2097.359s
52,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,now how we're gonna do that is by just editing the boundary of the slab and then bringing this ball down to meet that wall let's now go to our level 2 plan we're going to edit the boundary of it and we're just going to bring this to the inside of the walls so we're just going to snap using the align tool all of these lines to the inside you guys should be familiar with how to use the align tool now and so that should be good for now we are also going to have to figure out what's going on in this middle section but that will get rid of what's on the outside can't keep the wall and floor joined that's fine we're going to unjoin them and we will see in here the floor is no longer joined to that wall or the walls no longer joined to that floor and so what we're going to do we're going to select all of these new walls that we've created that we think can uh kind of squish down there a bit that's probably all we need to grab and we're going to change the base offset to be negative 320 and that should push them down and now we've got that flush finish if we wanted to we could just model this wall as one wall but since we've already created it that's going to be fine so next up let's have a look what's going on in the middle here i'm going to move back to my level 2 floor plan i'm just going to be looking at this photo here and i can see that that is a brick wall and there's going to be plasterboard on the other side as we saw in the living room photos and this is brick but this goes down all the way to the ground floor so this wall here was the brick wall with plasterboard on that side so let's go ahead and model that one in we're gonna make sure the top constraint is going up to the level two roof the base constraint is level two that's good let's go ahead and model that one in this is using the brick veneer with plasterboard lining i'm just gonna have a test and see if this is showing it on the right side we have a look in the 3d view i wonder if it will show us what side the bricks on which is this side which is good as you're coming up the stairs you see the bricks and then on the other side you see plasterboard so that's good right so next up is this brick wall that comes up all the way so as you can see we've already modeled in a wall this is a double brick wall going from the ground floor currently constrained up to level two however we we want this wall to go all the way up to the level two roof so i'm gonna change this top constraint to the level two roof i'm gonna get rid of the top offset i'm gonna make that zero but,2246.0-2396.32,534,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=2246.0s
53,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,we're gonna go back to the ground floor plan now and split this wall up we might need to be able to see the walls above it so we're gonna change the underlay again to show level one if we apply that now we can see where those walls are and so we're going to want to split the wall from this point here and then from the bottom of the stairs as well as you can see that will actually goes past the start of the stairs so i'm going to have to try and figure out what point that starts at that is probably i would say up to this point here just before the where the door was i don't think it goes all the way to the entry it doesn't look like it would it's up to this point so to split this wall we're to type sl otherwise the split tool is also up here called split element and we can just split it right at that point and it should just lock on that is split and if we split it also where this wall is so now we've just got this section of wool which is going to be going all the way up to the top if we change the range base layer to show level 2 we can see that that's where that wall is if we go to level 2 that is this wall here so we want the walls to connect so if we go ground floor we want this wall to connect to that wall what i could do is split the wall so that it's now halfway through here i don't think that's going to be the best option i think the best option would be to move the wall above in line with this wall here let's go to level two show the ground floor as the underlay and let's move this in line with the wall below and so now that wool can go across let me show you from the ground floor this wall can now go all the way up to the level two roof and if we don't want an offset we don't need that offset anymore let's have a look if this has worked in 3d it doesn't look like it has and that is because this wall is attached to the floor above it so we need to use the detach top from base tool and that is up the top here once you've selected the wall it's in the modify tab if you click detach top from base you just have to select what you want to detach it from and we want to detach it from this floor so we're just going to select that there we go now that wall comes all the way up which is how it looks in the photos that's really good and you can see that this wall is now cutting into that wall as well so we might have to edit that if we go to the level two floor plan,2394.88-2546.24,520,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=2394.88s
54,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,if we bring that back that is now in line with that wall and this wall is actually overhanging i can't remember if it actually does that in the floor plans so i'm going to bring this to the foreground and yes it does still come out a little bit there's a bit of an um like a large opening here but there's a frame that frames that opening gonna put that back on the background all right so now we've got this wall that goes from the ground floor all the way up that stairwell we need another wall that does the same on this side and that wall is going to go all the way across from this point to that point so if we go to level two that is going to be from here to here now this one's going to be a bit trickier because in the living room that's going to be plasterboard on this side of the wall but then in the stairwell this side facing the stairwell has bricks showing and then the opposite side has plasterboard to it and so i think we need to start cleaning up this section first before we start putting in more walls as you can see there are stairs in the way and the railings in the way and it just doesn't really look right so i think this ball here probably needs to be moved over a bit if we have a look at maybe the level one floor plan and you can actually see the outline of it this is meant to be pushed well further back so i'm just going to nudge that in fact i might use the align tool to align it to the stairs and have a look at that again in 3d that looks much better as you can see in the photos that's what we've got the stringer you've got steps you've got a brick wall that goes from the ground floor all the way up and so now we're going to have to put in a wall that goes all the way up and that is probably going to be this wall here so now this wall doesn't actually sit on the slab below it so let's have a look at the ground floor and see what's going on here and so now i guess we're just going to have to move the slab to make sure that it fits on there so i'm going to click on the floor below it and that's the entrance there so what we're going to do is just edit the boundary of that go to the ground floor and we're going to just snap this onto the edge of the wall we're going to accept that let's have a look at this in 3d there we go that's a bit better so now let's move this wall to go all the way up we can adjust the top constraint to go up to the level 2 roof there's no top offset so that's fine you can see it's still connected to that floor so if we detach it from the top,2544.4-2695.92,532,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=2544.4s
55,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 4 - Walls,or the base which is this floor plan there this floor slab i should say now that's moved all the way up and that is what we want but you can also see that this wool also doesn't quite fit onto that again we can probably just move that over and snap it onto there awesome okay so now we've got those walls in for that stairwell that's looking really quite good there's also going to be a railing that goes all the way down here we'll deal with that later now some of the materials won't be perfect here and you can see the wall is slightly off but for our sake i think that's going to be fine i'm going to guess that's probably just the real estate plan being wrong um we also need to adjust this balcony and the uh the floor slab i'm going to guess as well the floor slab is probably out as you can see there let's edit that we're going to go back to level two we're going to snap this onto those walls and then we can move that balcony out let's attach it all right now let's move this out edit the boundary snap that onto the slab that should be fine as well it's just a matter of making small adjustments along the way as well in the next lesson we'll be adding in the ceilings if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there,2693.76-2789.839,280,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=fuWNwtMHRPc&t=2693.76s
56,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,welcome to part five of the beginners revit course we'll be adding in the ceilings if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there we have all of our walls in the next thing we can do is add in some ceilings so to start creating the ceilings we're going to have to go back to creating some new levels this is so that we can create ceilings that are then constrained to levels so i'm going to go back to an elevation view i'm just going to click on the east elevation view that we've got up here and now we can see we've got a ground floor we've got a level 1 floor and a level 2 floor with their proper heights already in there then we've got the roof heights as well but we don't have any ceiling heights so what i'm going to do is hide away all of the roof levels and then i'm going to go right click it hide and view elements now we can see what we're going to going to be working with to find out the heights of the ceilings we're also again going to have to kind of guess off of the photos because we don't have elevation views we don't have pre-drawn up sections or anything like that giving us heights and so we're going to have to take some guesses and it shouldn't be too hard to do if we start with the front entrance we can already see that we know the height of this roof here this is actually the level 2 above and there is a soffit underneath that if we go back into our revit views we can see although we've just hidden them if we go to a different elevation we can see the heights of all of the other floors in fact if we go to the 3d view that is this part here so the ceiling in the photos is only just lower than that roof part which is hanging here and to find the height of that roof or that i guess the floor above what we can do is click on it and it gives us the level that it's constrained to and that is level two going back to our east elevation view we can see that level two is twenty eight hundred millimeters high in that sense if the ceiling is only just lower than that then the level or the ground floor ceiling is more than likely 200 mils less than that so i'm going to say that the ground ceiling is 2600 high if we go back to here we can go to the architecture tab go to the datum section and find where it says level now we can add in a new level we're going to make sure this this is the right way i'm going to click on it from this side and bring it across,0.08-154.84,528,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=0.08s
57,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,i'm going to rename this ground floor ceiling we're going to rename that view because then it's going to create a ceiling plan for us we're going to change this to 2600 and hit enter so that's the ground floor done let's have a look at the next rooms so then this is the room adjacent to the entrance which is the game's room i'm going to guess this floor continues on from the entrance i'm going to guess that's the same ceiling so that is fine the bathroom here looks a little bit lower but that's because actually this is actually stepped up if we look at the ground floor plan this bathroom here there's some steps that actually go up and so this is probably 400 millimeters up from the ground floor but i think all of this ceiling for the ground floor is exactly the same and we don't have any views inside of this bedroom so we can just go ahead and assume that they are all 2600. next we can have a look at level one if we have a look at the level one floor plan what does that entail that is all of this section across here and i'm going to assume again that these are probably all the same ceiling heights let's have a look at some of the photos this here is that main entrance so this is all through here that is very tall i'm guessing that cuts off about there and that's all goes up to the to the level two ceiling however this stuff along here the study we've figured out before that that was probably 2400 as well this is what we were looking at earlier and we said that this was probably 600 mils high if you go 600 and then you got maybe 1200 1800 2400 but that's a pretty fair guess then some of the bedrooms i have a feeling that these ceilings all carry on throughout that entire level and again we don't have photos of this bedroom or this bathroom so i'm going to go ahead and assume that all of this level is using that same height of 2400 so let's go back into the east uh elevation view and 2400 on top of level one is going to be let's get the calculator out 1400 plus 2400 so that's 3800 so we need a new level that is 3800 high go to the architecture tab go to the datum section click level we're going to bring this out we're going to rename this level 1 ceiling going to rename that again we're going to change the height of this to 3 800 and now we've got a level for the level 1 ceiling lastly we just need a level then again for the level 2 section and to do that we're going to have to have a look at these images,150.239-301.35999999999996,491,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=150.239s
58,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,again this might be a little bit taller it's also again kind of hard to tell but this probably roughly i'd say it's 2400 and if we wanted to we could actually count these bricks because this ceiling is going to go across the entire living room and kitchen so i feel like that's our best bet we're going to count 1 2 3 4 30 31 32 so 32 bricks high and what did we figure out earlier that a brick was what 90 mils high or 76 mils high i think we said 90. so we go 32 times 90 this ceiling is actually 2800 tall we're going to say it's 28.80 we're going to say 20 800. so that is a little bit taller let's go back to our east elevation and we can try and find our level 2 which is sitting there nicely so i'm just going to go to the north elevation we can see that level 2 is 2800 high so if we go 2800 plus 2800 that is 5600 let's create another level for the level 2 ceiling let's rename that yes we want to rename it this is going to be now that our levels are set up we can actually start putting in the ceilings and it's really quite easy let's go ahead and go to the ground floor first looking at the ground floor plan if that's not open because you've accidentally closed it like i just did then you can go back to your project browser and open up your ground floor i'm just going to slide that back over to the start again i'm going to turn off this underlay for the level above we don't need to see that and we're doing a ceiling for this space here so let's go to the architecture tab and you can see that there is a ceiling button next to the where the floor is which we used earlier if we click on that you can see that there is a compound ceiling which is plain as the type of ceiling i'm going to assume this ceiling is just plasterboard maybe being suspended maybe just on a roof structure i'm not exactly sure it doesn't really matter but it's going to model in a ceiling at the right height and then all the services and the structure and stuff that's usually given to you by the structural engineer by the services consultants all that stuff so we don't need to worry about that what i'm going to do is not have an automatic ceiling we're going to have to sketch in the ceiling ourselves so this is going to be placed on the ground floor but we don't want the height offset from the ground floor what we would prefer to do is use the levels we've just set up and to do that it's a bit difficult because it doesn't let us constrain to it so we're going to get out of this,300.24-451.199,505,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=300.24s
59,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,actually and we're going to go to the ground floor ceiling plan that we've just created under floor plans the first thing i'm going to do is check the phasing make sure that this is set to existing rather than new construction and now we're going to change the underlay of this view to show the ground floor below it now we can start modeling in the ceiling if we hit ceiling at the top here we're going to not have an offset from the ground floor ceiling plane because then if we move the level it's going to move all our ceilings in this um in our model instead of having to then change each ceiling height so that's the reason why we use levels instead of just using a height offset it's much easier much easier to work with in the long run as well and with service consultants or structural engineers they can just change a level instead of changing every single ceiling so we're just going to change that to zero we're going to change the phase created to existing which we've already done and now we can sketch in our ceiling the ceiling is going to go on the inside of all the walls it's not going to go to the outside and this is just going to go all the way around and we're going to actually go to where the stairs begin technically we should probably do these individually and i think that's the way i'm going to go so then you're not cutting through walls otherwise i'm just going to show you what this would look like if i did it all as just a single ceiling click the green tick when i'm ready i want to be able to show you the ceiling but obviously with all this other stuff in the way i can't so what i'm going to do is turn on a section box i've got nothing selected it's the view properties turning on a section box if we apply that there we go there's a big section box what this allows us to do is to drag in these little bits here and then we'll be able to cut through the building and we just rotated that accidentally and i'll show you what i mean if we cut this down to about there now we can see what's happening we've just created a ceiling in here you can't currently see it because it's um above the section box but that's going to be going around all of this and that means it's cutting through walls which is not what would happen in real life in real life you'd have a ceiling going from one area then you have another ceiling here another ceiling here another ceiling here we're gonna go back to the ground floor ceiling we're going to delete the ceiling we've just created and you might be thinking how do you select it i'm going to hover over this and hit tab to cycle through everything you can see that there's now a chain of walls or lines if you click click it again you've got the floors,449.68-599.8389999999999,533,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=449.68s
60,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,if you click it again there you've got the ceiling so i'm just going to delete that another way to do this is to click on the ceiling panel and go automatically sketching ceilings now what you can do is go to the ground floor plan if you want and you can automatically sketch these in and it's really easy sometimes it doesn't work as you can see it's not going to let me place one there i can place them everywhere else though and that's going to automatically create the ceilings this is okay but again because it's not constrained to a level it's going to be difficult to control the height of these ceilings i'd have to adjust each ceiling's height so instead we're going to stick to sketching it but that's always just an option if you want to do it off of the ground floor plan if you want to do it quickly maybe for a uni project or something i'm going to go back to the ground floor ceiling plan hit the ceiling button i'm going to sketch in a ceiling that's not offset because it's on the right height and now we're going to just trace around each area a little trick that you can do for this i'm going to hit escape this button here allows you to pick lines if we click on that we can now select lines and it's going to just pick all of those lines for us this can be good and this can be bad as you can see there's some that are extending super far but if we want to do something quickly this is definitely going to allow us to do that instead i'm going to just keep drawing them because i find that a lot easier we can also see that this ball here doesn't quite line up with that wool and that's obviously going to be a problem so we're going to have to adjust this wall here more than likely to line up with that wall now at the moment because we're cutting through this view at i believe 2600 the ground floor ceiling plan that's also cutting into the level 2 above and we don't want to see any of that but we do want to see the ground stuff below it so to do that we have to change the view range the way this works is pretty much all you're doing is just adjusting where the cut plane is for the floor plan so the top of the view that can probably stay the same but the cutting plane we want to be 2 800 or 2600 below what it currently is for the bottom of that this needs to be below the cutting plane so it's going to make this 5000 less and then this can be negative 10 000 it just needs to be below the bottom level so let's have a look and see if that does anything there we have it we can now see everything on the ground floor but then every time we make a ceiling on this ground floor ceiling,598.48-748.079,528,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=598.48s

62,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,go to the level one ceiling plan again and what we want to do is make sure that all of this is set up again we've got existing phasing because it's all existing then again we want to change the view range so that we can see what's underneath it i'm gonna make sure we show the underlay showing ground the view range all we need to do is change the cut plane to be zero so that it's at the same as this level which is the level one floor plan so then we can see everything on level one we're gonna change this to negative five thousand again i'm just going to hit tab twice to go down make this ten thousand below that level click apply now we can see that this is all where the level one ceiling's gonna go and again we can see that this slab slightly goes over that wall there which is not what we want we're going to just adjust that that floor i should have said not slab we're going to adjust that and then we're also going to have to adjust this carpet to make sure that that lines up as well and obviously there are some other things as well we might need to move around at the moment the level one ceiling is 2400 above level one so that is fine let's just start modeling in this ceiling if we sketch the ceiling in we can just do a square above the study and we're just going to double check all this it's on the right level it's existing that's good let's create a few more of them i'll hit enter to do the same command again i'm going to sketch that in but as you can see these are a lot lower than what we had previously the walls go up so then there'll be a bit more space for services and stuff like that which is how it should look we are also going to need a ceiling for the hallway also going to do now just these bedrooms and then that should be it alrighty so that's the end of those ceilings let's see if that's all looking nice that's what we've just created and i'm very happy with that so then all we need now is ceilings on level two so obviously we're just going to go to the level two ceiling plan again and do the same stuff we're going to make sure that the view range is correct and all of that good stuff we're going to make sure the phasing is set to existing and really we don't need to change the view range because we can already see what we need to see green tick to finish that off let's have a look at the 3d view that's quite nice and that is actually 2 800 above as well because that was a little bit higher from what we counted here and,896.8-1064.96,503,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=896.8s
63,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 5 - Ceilings,this ceiling will also go over this part here so let's just edit that again we'll go back to the ceiling plan and this is where we need to show you what's underneath it so let's try and um just change the base underlay see if that works there we go now we can see so then this is actually going to need a new ceiling we're not not going to use the same one but we're going to use the same level for it so we're going to hit ceiling again sketching a new one this can just be a rectangle again coming from that corner to this corner that should do the trick if we have a look in 3d view there we have it and then this brings up the question of what happens in here and around here because at the moment those walls don't go up as much as they should as we don't have photos of this my guess is that this wall would come across all the way and then there's a door in there and then this wall would come all the way up so let's go ahead and change the levels of this at the moment i believe that is just on level one yep it's constrained to level one the top constraint is level one roof we're gonna change this to the level two roof and that's gonna go up as much as we need it to and then this is going to come across all the way we're going to go to the level 1 floor plan and we're just going to drag that and then there's a door that goes in there not a door i think there's just an opening maybe it slides even from what i remember when i was a kid but um yeah there we go that is the ceiling's done in the next lesson we'll be introduced to using families by adding in windows doors and openings if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there,1061.76-1179.84,376,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qst2PW9mk0Y&t=1061.76s

65,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",glazing around there there's kind of these mullions and then horizontal slats and then there's glazing between it and opposite that as well or just a perpendicular to it i guess you could say there is the front entry let's have a look at what that looks like and that is this here so you can see that there's okay i guess a door a glazed door with three panels and that opens inwards and then you've got two fixed panels to the side of that as well so let's go ahead and model that in to do so we're going to use the architecture tab again and we're going to click on door now you can see that all we've got are single flush doors with different dimensions that's not really what we're looking for is it so we're going to have to load in a family of the door we want and you can do that by clicking up here under load family and here this is where you can find all of your doors and stuff all of the families that come with revit and these are going to be probably different for you than they are to me because there's an australian library there's a philippines library there's an american library and there's a whole bunch of different libraries from different versions of revit so this might look different to you and that's fine really we're trying to find a door that would fit in that spot and so if we go under here you can see that there are a whole bunch of other doors that aren't listed in our project already so what you can do is click on one of them and you can use the arrow key to go down and see what they all look like you can see a preview of it here i'm going to go down until i can find something with you know maybe three glass panels or something that looks similar and that looks pretty good except that's a double door we only need the single so we're going to go past double and we're going to try and find s for single and there's side lights singles we're getting into them and so it might be something like these where you've got the decorative panels not quite what we're looking for that's pretty good although there's not three panels there's um actually eight it's pretty close to what we're looking for even that could work it doesn't have to be perfect that's probably the best one at the moment single panel and we're just trying to find something that looks very similar at the moment i'm going to have to go with this single panel i'm not too sure if these are glazed so i'm just going to open one of these up and see what it looks like and i feel like that is not glazed we can maybe edit the type to change,151.92-302.479,500,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=151.92s
66,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",that we can see we can change the door materials and we can change the door panel let's see if we can change this to a glass and if we double click on that and apply it and click ok so i'm just going to place that in there and i'm going to go to the 3d view and see what that looks like okay you can see that the phase is set to new construction i'm going to change this to existing there we go now you can see start to see the materials and some of the things that are being shown because it's not just showing the existing stuff it's showing sorry it's not just showing what's new because everything here is built as existing it is now going to be showing what's existing and the materials in that so there we have it that's the panel that that we were looking at not really exactly what you know it's not matching this at all by any means but it's done a pretty good job and you know this is just a place holder i guess for the time being now if we go back to that ground floor plan we can line this up in the correct spot and so all i'm going to do is just nudge this over so that it roughly sits in the same spot as what is already there on both sides of the door there is an equal amount of width because i'm sure that this side is equal in dimensions to the opposite side you wouldn't have one that's slightly off that wouldn't really make sense and at the moment that's what we've got so you can change these temporary dimension lines to match from one wall to the other and you just move these blue little dots and it gives you a temporary dimension if we do that for the other one you can see that they're already on the right spot and it's showing that this is 770 and this is 865. so how do we get these to be even what i'm going to do is go to the annotate tab i'm going to use the aligned dimension tool and then i'm just going to go from one point from this wall to the center line of this door which will show up in blue once you hover over it and then i'm going to go down to the opposite wall if i drag this out and click again we now have dimensions from that wall and that wall to the center line of this door as you can see where i'm hovering here there's an eq button with a red slash through it clicking this will make these dimensions exactly the same they will make it equal that's what that stands for so if i toggle that they are now equal,300.639-451.52000000000004,486,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=300.639s
67,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",and that door is now in the center of these walls and we can double check that by creating a new dimension if we go from here to the center to the bottom they are both 1275 and that is equal i'm going to just delete these dimensions now you don't need them and you can keep that constraint on it or you can get rid of that constraint i'm going to keep it on there so that door even if we change this wall that door is going to stay in the center that door is going to stay in the center so now how do we go about creating these glass panels these windows and what we can do is go back to our revit model and click on architecture and then find where it says window right next to the doors and from here we can pick windows which we think are going to look the same so again there's nothing really here so we're going to have to load in a family we can do that and it brings us to the library for australia anyways and then i can look through here down to windows and we can start to have a look through all of the windows that come with revit now i'm going to scroll through these until i find one that looks similar to this here three panels which are glazed and they are fixed as well they don't open so none of these awnings or these double hung windows are going to help out and it doesn't look like there's anything in there so we might have to import a family and i'm going to go to revit city to find that but the files that you need are all in the project folder so i've just found a window here i'm going to place this into the model and obviously that overlaps with our walls but let's see if we can adjust these parameters at the moment if we go to a 3d view that's what it looks like not exactly what we were looking for but we might be able to edit this so back to the ground floor we're going to edit the type first thing we want to do is make it shorter or have less width so the width here is 960. what we're going to do is change this to well first we need to measure that the width is going to be roughly 800 mils so if we highlight this again edit the type change this to 800 for the width and we're also going to want to change the height of it because it is obviously floor to ceiling so that was 2400 so we're going to change the height to 2400 the default seal height can be zero because it can,450.319-601.7600000000001,479,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=450.319s
68,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",start on the ground and i think that might do what we're looking for if not we can figure that out so i'm gonna have to bring this down at the moment the seal height is still showing us 914 because it's the default seal height when i click zero bring that down that's looking pretty good it's not exactly as i said what we're looking for but for the for the sake of it it doesn't have to be the exact product that they used a hundred years ago or whenever this house is built definitely not 100 years ago but so what i'm just going to do is make sure that it's at the same height as the door and we can check that that is two one three four we're gonna have to go back in here and change the height to two one three four and then that should do the trick there we go now it's a little bit too short i'm going to edit this again and just give that a little bit more height so it can be at 2200 and that should be pretty damn close let's go back to our grand ground floor view make sure this is in the right spot we're going to align it to that wall so it's not sticking over it like it currently is and now we're going to copy this over using the copy tool or by typing co we're going to take it from this point and actually we're going to probably take it from this point here and drop it on the wall in line with that there we go now if we look at it in 3d we have the front entrance door and windows pretty cool huh let's continue to do this for the ground floor it's pretty difficult to see where all the windows and stuff are if you've got um the walls up as you can see we can't see that layer underneath anymore so again i'm going to change the transparency of these walls by overriding the graphics in the view by category and we're going to make that 60 again so now we can see through it and see where all the windows and doors are so you can see there's a door here i don't think there's any photos of that door no because this is where the door is and i'm going to guess it's just a timber door some similar material to this and i think we can just use the default the default door and that will look fine so i'm going to go back to the architecture tab click on door i'm going to use the single flush door and i'm just going to see which one is the right size what i can do you can see that the door swings the wrong way here by pressing space it's going to flip it and that looks pretty good to me i'm going to place that in there from,599.92-751.92,508,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=599.92s
69,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",this point to that point is 60 mils i'm going to change that to 50 just so it's not such an awkward number and then i'm going to hide i think that's the ceiling above which i can't see through i'm going to hide that in the view because i don't need to see the ceiling in the floor plan and now we can see this door as well what i think i'd be able to do is just copy over that same door and use that on this side as well there's also another wooden door across here so i'm going to use that same door again and just place that in here if we need to flip it we can press spacebar to flip it but that is fine and there we go i'm going to bring that off the wall a little bit we're going to make this 20 so then it's just not quite on the wall there's also another door in the bathroom here we're going to have to figure this out because i do know that there were some steps leading up to this bathroom it is not the same height as the bedroom from what i remember and then there's a door that swings so i think i'm gonna have to do one or two stairs and then bring this level up to maybe 400 mils i think the best way to do this is to then create a new level and put and assign everything on here constrain it to that level so now i'm going to go back to my east elevation click on level or you can click l to create a level and we're just going to come across maybe from 400 above and create a new level we're going to name this ground bathroom let's go back to our ground floor plan we can choose all of these wolves and we probably won't need to change that one but these walls that come across here they are going to be higher on this slab what i'm going to do first is assign the slab to that level and that looks like the slab there here we've got constraints to the left in the properties panel and we can change the level to the ground bathroom if we apply that and we go to our 3d view you will see that it's changed that so now that slab has been moved up 400 millimeters and we need to assign all of these other walls to that slab as well to that level so that they don't stick underneath like this so that will as well we can assign this wall is going to be a bit different because it goes all the way across but we're going to assign the base constraint for these to the ground bathroom and now they are all sitting on that ground bathroom i think 400 is probably,749.04-901.04,494,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=749.04s
70,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",too tall i'm gonna go maybe 360 and that's going to get rid of that gap we can actually go to the north elevation and that level is here we're going to change this level to be 300 if it lets me edit it there we go change that to 360. and because this is all assigned to a level the changes we make apply to everything that has that constraint set on it this part of the wall still doesn't um attach back down to that uh bathroom level that we've just put in so what i'm going to do is split that using the split element tool then select that and choose the top cont or the ground constraint to be for the ground bathroom now finally we're going to need to add in a stair case that goes up maybe two or three steps because that's what i remember it as there were either two or three but because they're not shown here and we don't have any photos this is total guess i did live in that house for over 10 years so i should know again we're going to go to the architecture tab and click on stare under circulation first thing we want to do is check the measurements so from this side of the wall to where the stairs would be there's about 860 in width so if we create a run and we make this 180 millimeter rises so we're going to edit this type we're going to duplicate this make it a 180 mil riser i'm also going to make it a 200 millimeter going so then there's a 400 or 600 mils length of stairs and we're going from the ground floor from the base level to the top level which is the ground bathroom so that's all good so this was 860 for the width as well let's not forget that i'm just going to draw it anywhere and it's just created three rises that's just going through a few things we can now select all of this we're going to use the we'll select that one we're going to use the move tool and we're going to snap that on to there we're going to align to that as well there we go probably don't need the railings on it seems a bit unnecessary for two steps even these stringers i'm thinking i might have to turn them off let's have no right support and then no left support as well if we click apply and okay there we go i actually didn't like the look of that so i've changed it from being having no right or left support to having a carriage open and so that's made this side of the step solid which looks a little bit nicer so back to the ground floor we're going to add in our door now,900.639-1051.6000000000001,487,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=900.639s

72,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",that one over place it around there we want them to be pretty well lined up so if we use the align tool we can align that one to that one except you can see that this is sliding the wrong way it needs to be sliding inwards to change that all you have to do is click on it and click this flip button there and so whereas these aren't centered we can do our best to just center them we don't need to make it perfect as long as these two are aligned in the middle i'll be pretty stoked with that if you wanted to you could put out some measurements from one side to the other and you can see that obviously one side's 40 mils the other side's 30 so then you can select both of these or actually you can select one of them change this temporary dimension to the middle of them which is 35 now both sides are 35 and now we know that that's definitely in the middle it's just when you've got two doors it's a bit trickier trying to use the equalize button so you might have to do that manually i'm going to delete that dimension now though and keep them constrained let's have a look at how this looks in the 3d view there we go not bad at all so let's try and compare this to what we've got that's the sliding doors there that looks pretty good so back to the ground floor let's find where those sliding doors are and they are here i'm not exactly exactly sure how they work but i'm going to click the door again use the same i think there's two sliding doors and we're just going to place that there i think it would probably go to the probably that way as well at the moment that's just for i guess references sake that looks like how it was in real life can't be 100 sure because we don't have photos of it and there's no elevations or anything we go back to the ground floor we can also see there are some windows on this side let's try and see if we can find them so they are too small that looks like a sliding window and then there's another window there which is awkwardly placed behind the stairs i'm going to place them in but i'm assuming they're exactly the same just two sliding windows that are quite small so i'm going to click on the window button again see if there's anything doesn't look like there is let's load in a family there should be something under windows in the library here i reckon we're going to use that one there and we can just change some of the parameters so as you can see as i've tried to import this family it's come up with a bunch of different parameters that we can import if i um,1201.28-1352.32,503,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=1201.28s
73,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",select one or more types on the right for each family listed then it's going to import all of them so for example i can select everything and click ok and then i'm going to import all of them and it's going to use more memory if you do import heaps of families for me not too fast i've got a lot of memory this should be fine so now i'm going to place this a sliding door or sliding window i should say it looks like it's the right the right width so that's pretty good pretty lucky just going to place just one of them and we can copy the other one over if we need let's have a look at this in the 3d view and see if it's what we're looking for really that's pretty good we're going to have a have to maybe change the height of it and the seal height as well we can probably calculate how high that is by counting the bricks again it's probably going to be you know around head height so i'm guessing i'm just going to put this as 1600 head height the head height there 1750 pretty damn close i'm going to change that to 1600 the height of it could be a little bit shorter so i'm going to edit the type i'm going to duplicate this and call it well what's the height of it at the moment 900 and 850 we're going to make this 600 height oh 600 high 600h we're going to call it change the height of it to 600 and click ok now you can see that's pretty good the head height has now changed though so we're gonna have to change that back to 1600 and there we go we've got the sliding window which is pretty damn close it's not perfect probably not it could could be a bit taller i'm not going to get too fussed about that now i can copy that one over back in our ground floor plan we're going to copy it and place it on this side i'm guessing they're exactly the same window have a look at that in the 3d view awkwardly sits behind the stairs just like it does here i don't know why um but there you go maybe the balcony was an extension and wasn't there before i don't know so now we've got a couple more to do on the ground floor we've got these high windows up here in the games room let's try and find what they look like they are the same kind of sliding door or sliding window i should say but maybe a little bit wider so let's try and find that same family we just used and use a wider one so as you can see we've chosen a lot of them i'm guessing maybe,1349.84-1500.48,486,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=1349.84s
74,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",what we can do is measure it go from one end to the other it's going to be about 1200 wide so if we use the 1208 that should actually be the same width as the other ones so this is probably the same window that's being used there that's good to know we're gonna place in three of them we're gonna have a look in the 3d view see what that looks like as you can see they're not exactly the same as the ones we created earlier these are 1208s these are the 600 high so let's change these to be the right family type just by selecting them all going to the drop down menu in properties and finding 600 h now the head height of these these are quite tall they are pretty much touching the ceiling which was 2400 if we remember from previously so we're going to make the head height 2300 there we go that looks pretty damn good i would say that's what we've got now we've also got some large windows in here which we're going to have to address there are no photos from what i remember of what they look like actually there might be okay there we go that's the large window so what we're going to do is just go to windows i'm going to try to find one that matches that and they're not sliding and it doesn't really match any of the fixed ones could be one of these casement windows if they were a little bit wider but they're not quite what we're looking for so let's have a look under windows and see if we can find anything otherwise another thing we could do is just change this wall type to be a curtain wall which is what this is it's a curtain wall of glazing if we select this wall we can change the wall type you can see down here at curtin wool to store front or just curtain wall i'm going to try storefront and see what that looks like it's giving us some errors but we might need to split this wall before we make any changes so i'm going to just ctrl z that and then go back to the ground floor we're going to split this where it reaches the window because i don't think that continues inside using the split element tool again we're just going to be splitting it from there and again we can probably split it at this point here so now we've got this what we can do go back to our 3d view so i'm going to select this wall i'm going to change the property type to the storefront we can edit the type of this curtain wall and make some changes i'm going to duplicate this so we don't mess around with anything we're going to call this entry glazing and you can see there's a grid that we have to set up so at the moment there is a mullion on the bottom and on,1497.76-1648.72,517,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=1497.76s
75,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 6 – Doors, Windows, Openings",the top horizontally there's a distance of 2400 between them let's see how many there are okay so there's one two three four mullions that have horizontal if we divide 2400 by four it should come up with six hundred so let's make the spacing six hundred again how many are there vertically one two three four five i wonder if it tells us that the width of that if not we can go back and change that so as you can see we've just made that 600 for horizontally and now there's extramarions in there but now we need to figure out the width of this so if we go to the ground floor go to the measure tool we're going to measure the distance between these and then divide that so it should be about 2 000. if we go back to 3d view and we edit the type of this again let's go 2 000 divided by 5 which should be 400 and then apply that let's have a look at it not quite what we were after i'm going to double that actually to make it 800 and there we go now we've got one two three four five mullions there and then one two three four five horizontally and that looks pretty good it's pretty close to that so i'm pretty stoked now lastly on the ground floor we've got one more window which is in the bathroom let's go back to the ground floor and let's put in this long window here which is more than likely i believe that's sliding if we look at the photos there we go you can see it's sliding going that way so that's going to be the same as this type but just longer so let's go to the architecture tab click on window go to this sliding one and we're going to click on the 600 high we're going to place that in but we're going to now edit this type and duplicate it we're going to call this 600 high and then 1800 wide we can change the width of that then to 1800 click ok there we go i'm just going to nudge that over to 100 make sure that it's sliding the right way if we look in the 3d view we should be able to figure that out i think that's actually going to be a bit higher as well because this floor is remember 400 higher so let's make this 1900 which is 1500 plus 400 so that's a little bit higher not everyone can look in and see you showering which is nice and that's all of the ground floor windows and doors finished i'm going to go ahead and finish the,1648.159-1799.1999999999998,462,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gKpsyQ76pWY&t=1648.159s

78,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,almost all of our slabs back let's see what's going on with the tiles in the bathroom looks like i forgot to unhide that before so i'm going to unhide the floor that we hid before now we have our slabs back we've got the wolves back and we've got already what looks like a pretty good floor plan obviously there's still a lot to do to the floor plan and we'll get into that a bit later but for the moment let's create a roof so where exactly does the roof go over that's what we need to figure out if we look back at the images again that's not telling us a whole lot that gives us a little bit of information you can see that the roof goes all the way it goes parallel to the wall and it goes all the way towards that back wall just before where that window finishes and so because we don't have a roof plan we don't have the outline of the roof on top of the floor plan we're going to have to make some guesses here but we can see that it comes just before that window so let's draw this in i'm going to set the range base underlay for level 2 so that we can see what's going on with these walls here we know that there was a well we can't actually see the window there at the moment so we might have to do some changes to that because what i want to be able to see i want to be able to see this window so that we can draw a roof in that is just before that window to do that i'm going to use reference planes because i can't see it with my range base level set for level 2 what i'm going to do is go to my level 2 floor plan and i'm going to create a plane to reference you're not modeling up anything but you're modeling up a reference plane and that's what this is up here in the architecture tab so you go to architecture go to work plane and you click on reference plane what this allows you to do is to find that point that you want to reference and you can draw a line from it it's not modeling up anything it is just something to be able to snap to and be able to select now this should be visible on level one as well there we go and so now we know that's the start of that window we look back here just to confirm that is where that window starts and so we want the roof to be just before this we're going to do a measurement of the wool to that reference plane and that's showing 735.8 so my guess is that the roof is going to have a 700 millimeter overhang if we go to the architecture tab and we find where the roof by footprint button is this is going to allow you to create a roof by sketching it out so what i'm going to do is just use the line tool i'm going to create a line that is 700,150.959-302.23999999999995,545,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=150.959s
79,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,millimeters from that wall and this is going to be the overhang for the roof now let's go back and have a look at our image we can see that it also overhangs and extrudes out past that wall how far it is we're not exactly sure but i'm going to guess again that it's the same as the sides and they're both all the overhangs are going to be 700 mils so this wall here is 8 180 millimeters if we add 700 to that that is 8 80. so i'm just going to ride in 880 and there we go that's going to be 700 mils out from that wall extruded past as well as from this wall here so now we're going to go across again we're going to find that this wall here is 8 832.4 millimeters that is a very awkward number to calculate so i'm going to grab that in my calculator 8832 i've already lost it now let's have a look at that again and we're going to add 700 to that that's going to be 9532.4 millimeters what you can do is just oops won't let me paste that i thought maybe i could copy that in from the calculator i can't so i'm going to just type in 953.2 make sure i snap onto that nine five three point oh nine five three point two that doesn't sound right nine five three two point four is what i meant and now we're going to bring this all the way back to this is going to snap onto the line we've already created and we're going to bring that across and it says they might overlap so let's have a look at what's going on there going to bring that one back and as you can see i've already created a line there so i'm going to delete that line extend this one out now we're good if we create a roof like that you're going to notice that it's created a shape of the roof for us and also this is on the wrong level so the base level for this is going to be since we've already set up the levels the level one roof there we go but that's not exactly the shape of the roof we wanted if we click off of that it doesn't look like this roof here which is what i think a gable i should probably check that out but i'm just going to take a guess it's either a gable or hip roof and so what we've also used is the 400 and 400 millimeter basic roof which is,301.199-452.23999999999995,446,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=301.199s

81,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,looking like there we go let's make this a bit bigger get a good comparison of it does that look roughly the same it's pretty darn close i would have to say the question is now how do we extend these walls up because there's this big old gap here which doesn't really make much sense and it's also going to be the bring up the question of what happens here and so because we've got no photos of that side of the house this is going to be pretty hard to figure out so what i'm going to try to do is go on to google maps and see if i can get an overhead shot of what this looks like all right so here we are on google maps i'm going to blur out the road name and street numbers it's still a little bit hard to see what's going on but this roof that we've just created you can see it actually covers that part in revit so this should come over and cover this bit whereas the other roof covers everything else that's what it looks like to me and so then there would be a wall that extends down into that roof space let's just go ahead and model up this roof to then extend out like it should edit that footprint again let's have a look at the level two floor plan i'm just gonna have a play around here let's have a look at 3d we need to line it up to this wall so whereabouts is that that would probably be this wall here that line so i'm just going to make a reference plane and extend that out i'm going to bring this line all the way up to be in line with that reference plane i'm going to bring this back to probably the outside of this wall here and then create another line that follows that snap it onto there snap it onto there let's have a look if this works and as you can see the slopes are obviously not set up properly so let's check that out this is defining the slope we don't want it to this is defining the slope we don't want it to untick that should fix our problems there we go i think that is probably what we want if we look at this from a top view which you can do with this button here this is what it looks like from the top and this is what it looks like in google maps i think we'd be right to say that that's pretty close i'm pretty happy with how that roof turned out so now the question is how do we extend these walls up and the answer is really simple we're going to select these three walls we're going to click on the attach top,599.839-749.44,486,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=599.839s
82,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,to base we're attaching this to the roof click on the roof it's as simple as that i'm just going to double check this up against our reference image again and let's have a look if the roof looks quite the same it's pretty close but now i feel like these windows could probably be higher because it looks like there's a lot more room up here than there is here and some of these windows could also be a bit bigger these windows are obviously a bit too small and so now we're going to have to make some adjustments to that i'm going to make these the same height as these windows here i think that will make it look a bit neater and yeah you can see they're the same sill height the same head height it's just a matter of changing these to what is it 1400 high so we're going to edit the type and we're just going to directly change this height to 14 actually we're probably going to duplicate this in case we use it anywhere else we're going to change this to 1400 high so let's change that height 1400 click ok and then we're just going to change these two to be that same window type okay now that looks a bit better now these windows are probably not correct either but we have no images from them on this side so we've done the best we can from memory all right so that roof looks good for level one let's do level two we've moved to the level two floor plan we can delete that reference plane we created earlier and we're gonna try and figure out where this roof overhangs again and so we can look at i'm gonna go on google maps looks like it's overhanging a lot more than what that one did but also it's in line on this side with the roof that we've already created now what's really cool because we've already created a level one roof level it gives us a plan as well so we can open that up to see where the roof is for level one and there's something going wrong with the view range on this view by default the cut plane is going through the roof so all we need to do is make this cut plane higher i'm going to make that 2000 and see if it fixes the issue there we go so this is our roof plan currently for level one i'm going to create a reference plane from the edge of this roof because that's what we need to snap onto on our level 2 roof plan as well again for this plan i'm going to bring back all of our visibility by removing the transparency on our walls and slabs so we've got the reference plane this is where the roof will extend out to,748.0-900.639,492,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=748.0s
83,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,by the looks of google maps and then it's a matter of finding how far over it extends on that roof we can see it extends out i would say probably just less than what that is so that's 700 this probably extends out maybe four or five hundred and then on this side again that looks like it's extending just over the balcony and actually this one probably lines up with the balcony too so now that we know that that's really helpful because we can create a reference plane from the balconies and this is what the roof is going to snap to there was a slight overhang again remember on the front here and that was probably going to be about 700 just like the front to create this reference plane we can't actually just do a measurement of 700 there's no measurements that we can snap to so what i can do is type in the offset 700 and then we're going to offset from this wall and go like that bring it around now we're 700 from that wall now we have the outline for our roof using reference planes however there is one other thing that we need to consider that there's a little cut out here where the other roof goes under and i'm guessing that this the level two roof overhangs the level one roof by the same distance as this so if we get back to our level one roof plan we can see where that roof is and we're going to do another reference plane which is 700 millimeters off of this uh wall so we're going to change the offset again to 700 click on that wall and then bring it around to snap like that and then again just for ease of sake i'm going to create some reference planes that show where those wolves go i'm going to go back to my level 2 plan alrighty now we're we're in business let's go ahead and go roof by footprint using the architecture tab and we're just going to draw and snap to these points so draw from here we're going around to the edge of the balcony where that reference plane is going down to this reference plane then this comes out to the edge of that wall there comes down to where that reference plane is but also overhangs a bit so we go to this reference plane go to that plane i've just overshot there i'll bring that back bring one more line in to finish it off there you go you can see we've got the form of it if we tick it it's also looking a bit weird and this is also going to be on the wrong level we want this to be on the level,897.76-1049.679,474,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=897.76s
84,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 7 – Roof,two roof all right let's have a look at that the shape of it looks pretty good but we're also going to have to make some adjustments to the slope if we edit the footprint again what we want to be sloping is this one this one and this one the other ones we can all turn off they do not define the roof slope and we're going to adjust these to have the correct roof site and it's going to be exactly the same as what we did there which was 18 so let's select all of them and change the slope to 18 degrees if we accept that let's have a look at what that looks like it doesn't quite look right there's something going on here that wasn't meant to happen and if we look at the front of it that looks like it's going to be a bit way too tall this slope doesn't look as steep as this one here if we look at that from about the same view that looks like it's a much more subtle slope so i'm going to guess that this slope here is not 18 degrees this is more like 10 degrees so let's make that adjustment we're going to select all of the slopes all of the lines we're going to change the slope to 10 degrees if we accept that that's more subtle that looks a bit more realistic and i think that makes sense now let's figure out what's going on at the front here i think what we've got to do here is turn off this as sloping let's see what that does there we go that looks more realistic however there is one issue in the photo it looks like there's a much bigger gap than what we have this roof might be sloped a bit too not subtle and i think that's the case i'm going to drop this down to 10 degrees like that roof is and i think i can just change the slope from here and it's going to change all of them and that's going to look a lot better once we extend all these walls up as well that's going to look perfect i'm not too sure if this does overhang like it does at the moment let's have a look at the other photos on the balcony i think that's fine once we get a column in there that will look normal all right so let's extend all of these walls up to the roof we're just going to select them all i'm holding ctrl and that's all of them selected let's attach top size base to the roof and there we go isn't that starting to look really good in the next lesson we'll be adding in some finishing touches such as railings columns and gutters if,1047.52-1203.6,481,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=_7TlYlEWGCQ&t=1047.52s

87,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",and you can see that it's a bit too high up in the images it should be just below the balcony or maybe in line with it so now what i want to do is align this the bottom of this slab to the bottom of this slab i'm going to click on the bottom of that click on the bottom of that there we go i'm going to use the align tool again to align to that tick that one off now i'm going to assume there's some posts holding it up on this side as well so let's do some posts there's also a post sitting here holding up the floor above let's go to the ground floor plan i'm going to go to architecture and you've got columns here we can have either structural columns or architectural columns the columns we're using are going to be architectural and what i want is a round column and it doesn't look like there's any loaded in so we're going to load in some columns if we go to the australia folder otherwise you should have some anywhere else go to columns we're going to have a look at some of these do we have any round columns yes we do load that one in this is a 152 mil diameter that could be about the same as that there's only one way to find out we're going to add it in we want to try and line it up nicely with that wall as well as that wall there and we've just placed it in but we haven't checked where we're placing it at the moment it's only going up to the ground bathroom which is 400 mils above the ground floor we want this to be attached to level 2 which is that floor above and that should be 28 mils high let's have a look at if that worked beauty but it's going all the way up so we want to make it not go through this slab which is 320 mils thick so we're going to offset this 320 mils oops from the top offset negative 320. there we go and i remember there was some real shitty rotting timber or wooden posts that were holding up the carport as well i'm going to use the same one but i'm going to make it thinner and diameter i'd say they're probably around 120. it's going to edit this i'm going to duplicate it and just call it 120 millimeter round we're going to change the diameter to 120 click ok we're going to go to ground and we're going to create a new architectural column that is at 120 millimeters i'm going to place this in line with that one and so now our columns in there i'm going to actually go to the 3d view and i'm just going to attach the top and base,153.28-304.56,490,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=153.28s
88,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",to that level above and we can copy this one over in our ground floor view and so i remember there being maybe three or four columns or posts running through here and that is where you can use the array tool i'm going to select this column i'm going to click on the array tool which is this little four square button up the top here in the modify tab before we select the column to array we're going to set it up we want to move it to the last column and we're going to want maybe four columns between here so now we can select it and the end of the carport and there you go there's four equally spaced columns if we changed our mind and we only wanted three of them we can change that otherwise we can still change this if we change our mind again to five now you've got five columns and it's parametric but we're going to keep it as four they are still grouped up so you can always change that even after you select off of it let's have a look at this in 3d view i think that looks pretty good we've got the carport there we've got a post there now we need some posts holding up this roof above because i don't think that would cantilever off like that although it might and there might just be a balustrade that runs around it so let's have a look at that as you can see that is a down pipe coming down there i don't think there's a column attached to it and there's no there's definitely no columns around here but there's definitely a balustrade that runs around a rail okay so you can see that there's a column holding up this post bit here if i wanted to model that in it would be quite simple i can just go to the level two and i'm guessing it's this part that hangs over we can create a wall make sure you save your project i'm gonna make this something generic maybe like the 200 ml wool and we're just going to draw making sure we're connected to the right finished face we're going to draw around this part here and now we can offset this to be a lot higher so this door i'm guessing it sits above that door as you can see there it's roughly maybe four or five six hundred millimeters above the doors so what we want to do is select both of these walls now we're going to attach the top and base to the roof above now that that's done we just need to bring up the base so that it's not covering up everything so i'm going to select both of these walls now we're going to have a base offset of 2500,301.52-453.52,485,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=301.52s
89,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",and there we go that is that bit modeled in they could probably be a bit higher let's make this 2800 i like that number better anyways alrighty so then from that there's a column that stems down let's go to our level 2 floor plan that column is going to sit about here in between those two walls that we've just made to go to architecture column architectural we're going to use another 152 mil column i'm just going to place that in the middle of those two again that's probably not going up to the right level let's have a look at this in a 3d view definitely not we can adjust this height to the top level which will be up to level two roof that will do the trick the other thing there is when i'm looking at this image you've got the rail obviously which we'll come back to but you've got this storage bit here which was holding all the pull toys that we used and again this storage bit isn't shown in the plans but you can see that it sits pretty much aligned with the staircase so i'm going to go to the ground floor we're going to model it in below the stairs so we're just going to do a generic wall again and this one's going to be a lot thinner this can be 100 mils we're going to the exterior and we're just going to model this in like that obviously hasn't been to the right height again what we're going to have to do is edit this profile we select both of these we're going to bring them all the way up to this level we want to bring it up to the extent of what we want to have the walls at so that means the top level is going to be level two so what we can do is just adjust the top offset of this to be negative 320 or negative 300 so then it sits just below that that floor slab and obviously that's not quite big enough so let's go to negative 200 there we go that's perfect it's not showing up there it's not showing up underneath that is fine this one's the problem how do we get that profile and as you can see it sits directly below this support what we have to do is go up to top here and click edit profile now what we're doing technically is just going to adjust this and snap it to that i'm going to delete that line we're going to just draw out the shape of this i'm going to delete that i'm going to bring this one in and then i'm going to draw that line in from there to there and now,451.039-602.6400000000001,473,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=451.039s
90,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",we've just created the profile of this wall once you click the green tick you're now going to have that wall bit cut out and so there we go now we want to change these walls to look something similar to this if you've got access to the files on the website you can go ahead and do that or you can have a look for a lattice pattern yourself and then create this wool type as well so what i've had to do is use a model pattern the next thing i want to add in is the fence or the balustrade or the railing whatever you want to call it that goes around the balcony and the stairs so let's have a look at the image there is a railing that goes up the stairs and follows around actually it goes to a gate here and there's a different type of railing that goes around the balcony this is pretty simple to do we'll go to the level 2 floor plan and we're going to select this just so we can see where the balcony is i'm going to go to architecture and this is under railing under circulation what we can do is sketch a path all i'm going to do is we can use the 1100mm railing that's default because that looks like it's about 1100 millimeters high we're going to edit the type and we're just going to see how this rail is structured we look at the baluster placement so there's 25 millimeter square balusters there's two balusters per tread even though these aren't on stairs and we can see that they are every 275 millimeters from the previous baluster let's have a look at what this looks like we'll click ok on there we're going to sketch this in we go around the balcony up to that point there then to here so we've just created a continuous line around the balcony click that green tick let's have a look at what this looks like pretty damn good the balances could be slightly more together i'm not going to be too fussed about that to be honest i think that's pretty damn good just to automatically generate a railing next thing we want to do is then put the railing on this stair and it's just on the one side of the stairs so if we go to the level 2 floor plan again we click on the stair here now this time instead of using the drop down menu to sketch a path i'm going to use place on stair or ramp and we can go on the stringer not the treads because we want it to be on top of the stringer as we can see in the images it's coming up from the stringer and then what you can do is just select the stair that you want to add the railing to you click on it and it creates railings on both sides however we only need it on the one side,600.48-753.12,513,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=600.48s

92,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",the balcony pretty much all done the stairs have railings on it now and i think this side looks pretty good while we're on the topic of stairs we need to fix up the stairs on the inside so the best way to do that let's have a look at it in the ground floor plan i don't think there's any point modeling in the basement that is underground um there is a secret door here but we're just gonna keep that hidden for now looking at this image we're going to need that railing that goes all the way through the middle and it has a railing that goes up like that i'm going to go to the 3d view and this is where the section box is going to be really helpful and let's bring this through so that we can see the stairs we can see that there's meant to be a kind of wall that goes all the way up and then there's a railing that sits on top of that wall and goes around here we can't actually see it on the ground floor but i'm going to assume this goes down to the ground so let's go to the ground floor plan and let's model that in i'm going to just click on this stringer to give us a reference and the wall is going to come up just behind that stringer create a new wall in my eyes this looks like it's only probably 20 millimeters thick so let's use a 20 mil thick timber we're going to call this actually maybe 40 millimeters timber stairs support let's change this structure we're going to make this 40 mils and we're going to edit this to be a timber click ok click ok now let's create a new wall going from the edge of the stringer up like this this is going to be starting from the ground floor going up to let's try level two it's probably going to be less than that though so you can see that this is actually a part of the stringer there's the stringer there there's the stringer there this is coming up from that and i think what i'm gonna do here is remove the stringers and just have this ball act as the stringer so if we click on the stairs and edit the type i'm going to duplicate this in case we've used it anywhere else and say no left stringer so then we're going to look for the left string of support we're going to make this none and you'll see that it will disappear we can then change this to be that same type which is no left stringer and this wall is going to if we go back to our ground floor view this is now going to be in line with that so if we select that wall we can align it just like that i'm going to actually extend this out to this wall so we're going to go back to the ground floor this wall is going to come back a bit,901.199-1054.0,524,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=901.199s
93,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",this can come in line with there and likewise that can line up there we'll have a look in the 3d view that looks a bit better now it's just a matter of finding the right profile for this stringer you can see that it's slightly higher than the stairs probably 600 millimeters above and then the actual railing is another 200 to 400 above so that means that this wall here it's going to have a top offset from level two 600 because then we can carve out the right size of the stringer for this and that means we're also going to need a wall that runs along here which is the same thickness as this so if we go to level two and we draw in a new wall we can make it with the 40 mil timber stair and this is going to go up to unconnected we're just going to make this go up 600. if we draw this in we can just throw it off to the wall there i'm going to make this a little bit thicker this should actually be 50 mils that's what the previous stringer was so let's change this to 50 click ok that should be fine there we go we're going to extend this out again there we go that just needs it up a bit okay so again we're going to have to edit the profile of this and so we're going to bring this down to the bottom riser so from the bottom riser we're going to create a line that is 600 millimeters tall and that's going to connect to this other point which is also 600 millimeters tall this should give us the profile we need let's accept that and so now all we need to do is add the railing on top of that and that's a little bit more difficult but it's still pretty easy to do let's go ahead and draw that in and i'll show you how to do that so we're going to go to the level 1 floor plan just so we can see that this in floor plan mode we're going to hit railing sketch a path we're going to draw a straight line going from one end to the other and then around again to this point and we want to pick a new host for it in fact let's pick that as a host and let's click the green tick and see what it looks like okay that's not bad but it's also way too tall let's edit this we're going to duplicate it we're going to call this 400 millimeter now we can change the height of the top rail here and we're going to make this 400 click ok that made it a little bit smaller and you can see we're going to have to bring down this point a little bit to match up with,1052.799-1210.64,493,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=1052.799s
94,"Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 8 – Columns, Railings, Gutters",that wall there or inversely what we can do is bring this up to then connect to that point so then all we need to do is just attach this we can align it using the bottom of the railings i'm just hit tab to then select over that point and then we can connect that to there this isn't the exact rail link this railing should curve around as well going down through there but because i don't actually know how this works it's going to be a bit difficult to do that and so i'm going to leave that for the for this part if you wanted to do that you could play around with having this curve around but for the sake of not actually knowing how that works it's going to be a bit difficult but you've already been shown all of the things you can do with rails how you can place them on hosts how you can create them to follow stairs how you can just align them along a a slab you've been showing all of the applications for us for a rail so go ahead and have fun with it i'm going to go ahead and turn off this section box and really we're on the stage where we're doing some final touches and we're starting to present the model another final touch we can do is as you can see there are gutters on these grooves up here there's the down pipe that comes from that gutter up there and on the other side there is also a gutter how do we put gutters in in revit very simply we go to the roof the same as we had before but we use the drop down menu now to go roof gutter from here literally all you need to do is select the point of the roof that you want a gutter to come from and you click on it there you have a gutter at the bottom of that roof does that look right no not really i'm going to undo that the gutter usually sits on a fascia and what a fascia is is just the backboard for the gutter to sit on so if we go to roof fascia we can put a fascia on to this side of the roof and as you can see that's just put a little lip on it which then allows you to go back to architecture roof gutter allows you to hang off a gutter there you have it then you can go around for the rest of these put on a fascia so if we go to architecture roof fascia click on there and then also on these sides as well there would be a fascia there now all we need to do is add another gutter to them roof gutter and you want to click on the bottom points of these where the fascia is there you go now you know where the,1208.88-1363.44,504,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA,https://youtube.com/watch?v=o4zRJsURTRA&t=1208.88s

96,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 9 - Presentation,welcome to part nine the final tutorial in this revit beginners course we'll be presenting our model by creating and cleaning up the drawings as well as being introduced to rendering in revit if you'd like to get access to all of the course files materials and resources as well as four hours of ad-free content you can feel free to head over to my website and check out the course i'll see you there for the most part of this course we've been working in floor plan views but what about elevations and sections we've really been ignoring you know elevations and sections which is interesting because a big part of architecture is working in elevation and sections and we haven't really been presenting our work so let's get into doing that first we're going to create some elevations as you can see we've been working in elevation in order to work out where the levels go and what you probably haven't noticed is that your building has also been shown in elevation in these views as you've been modeling up your building you have also been drawing your elevations your sections your floor plans your details everything you can think of in an architectural documentation set right now we're sitting on the east elevation if you look under your elevation views you can see you've got a north one that's your north elevation you can see you've got a south elevation if we try and find that right click on there and go zoom to fit oh no we don't have a south elevation so we're gonna have to look into that the west elevation that is over here as well but something doesn't look right there so let's have a play around and organize these elevations to then make them look presentable let's go to the ground floor plan at the start of this course we looked at what elevation markers look like and we haven't touched them since and you might be thinking we hid our elevation markers at the start but if i open that up i still don't see them anywhere and so what this leads me to think is that our elevation markers are being shown on the wrong phasing if we change the phase to new construction i've got a feeling our elevation markers will pop up there we go and this is probably why we cannot see some of our stuff in our elevations what we can do is now move these elevation markers to be in the right spot so that they're showing what we want to show i'm going to hide away this raster image now by hiding and view the element now i'm going to move these elevation,0.0-152.879,460,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4&t=0.0s
97,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 9 - Presentation,markers to be surrounding my building this is the south elevation marker and i've just moved the marker so far i haven't moved the actual elevation view if we click on this point here this is the elevation view this is deciding what is being shown i'm going to pull this back to behind my building and now this being the south elevation marker we can look at that and look at that our building is being shown the worst one we couldn't see earlier that well anyways this is being shown really strangely like it's not being cut through properly so let's have a look at where our west elevation market is if we click on that you can see that it's showing probably only from this part part of the building onwards if we bring this back to this point here in fact i'm just going to move that whole elevation marker across and that's being shown from there let's now have a look at that west elevation wow look at that it's being shown properly so this elevation mark a bit here is what's showing everything in front of it for the north one it's currently showing everything in front of it but if we were to move this up here now it's going to be doing a cut section through halfway through the building as you can see if we go back to the ground floor and we move this back to where it should be the north elevation is going to update and show everything in front of it that is not the correct way to make a section cut though by moving this the correct way to make a section cut is by going either to the top here and create a section view or by going to the view tab and clicking on the section icon here now what we can do is we can pull this section marker through the building it's going to show everything on this side being cut through here we can actually go to this view by right clicking on the section market and clicking go to view now you can see we've created a section through the building which is showing everything that we needed it to again we can move this back and it's going to do a different cut through the building now it's showing the front entrance which is this part here and you walk in there's the games room door there's the bedroom door and there's stairs that go up and up to the level 2 space but at the moment it's not showing everything behind it and that's because this point needs to be dragged out,150.48-305.759,454,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4&t=150.48s
98,Revit Course for Beginners – Revit Tutorials to Learn BIM Fast | Part 9 - Presentation,then it's going to show everything behind there that looks a bit better to neaten up our ground floor you can actually split this section marker and drag these points out so that it's not in the way of the drawing but let's continue to move our section markers into the right place this one up here can be dragged down and this east one can be dragged across as well just make sure to bring the actual points with it too this one should still be out here we need to drag that one over now let's have a look at all of our elevations the east elevation is looking pretty good you don't need the section marker in an elevation view so i'm going to hide that element in the view now all of these levels over here we do want to show that in the elevation but why are they so far away what we can do is actually drag these over but rather than dragging them all because that is going to change where the levels are we can just click on one and then drag this point out and it's going to drag all of them out then you can drag this point and it's going to bring all of them in and we don't want them to cover the drawing so we're going to show them like that now obviously we don't need all of these levels to show in an elevation view for example we want to show where the ground floor is we want to show where level 1 is we don't really need to show where the ground floor ceiling is though so we can hide that in this view again we want to show where level two is but we don't need the level one ceiling or the level two ceiling so let's select both of them and hide them in the view i'm gonna drag these in a little bit more and already this is starting to look a lot neater if we wanted to we could change the visibility settings to show a visual style we can show it as shaded we can show it as realistic and that already gives it a pretty cool look we can also add shadows and we can do that by pressing this button here there you go you now have an elevation that looks realistic with shadows on it let's go ahead and go to the north elevation and do this once more as you can see the levels are all over the place and it does not look very neat what we can do is drag these out and we're going to attach all of these to that same spot boy that's a bit of a mess so what levels of these do we not need to show again probably all the same ones as,304.479-455.599,485,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dirXEE0r1b4&t=304.479s

102,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,i've got 20 tips tricks and shortcuts for you to work more speedy and efficiently in revit learning revit is hard enough so don't do it by yourself in my new revit beginners course you'll learn revit in a fast fun and easy way by actually modeling up a real three-story residential project if you want to get on board check out the link in my description and i'll see you there now let's get on with these 20 revit hacks tip number one is about using work sets work sets are a collaboration tool inside revit used to help organize your file go up to collaborate click worksets here you'll be starting up work sharing inside your revit file now you don't have to be collaborating with others to use work sets but this is what you'll be doing you can move all the levels and grids to a work set which is fine and you can move the remaining elements to a work set we can just call this work set because the end game of this is to have all of your walls on a layer to have all of your rooves on a layer and all of your let's say plumbing or services stuff like that so that you can easily just hide them in your whole project rather than filtering out all of your walls and then clicking hide and view which is a terrible way to go about this what you can do is just tick off the work sets and it will hide it across the entire project because this is just a beginner's video we won't touch too much more on work sets but that's all you need to know about it that you can hide things across your entire project which is the much more proper and efficient way to do things inside of revit especially when working across different disciplines inside the industry now how annoying is it when you're working in a project and then you accidentally click on a door or something and that loads up the family this is something that can really screw up your workflow you might be modeling along and then you accidentally double click on something and it just screws you over so there's a way to change what double clicking on an element actually does and you can change it so that it doesn't open up this view because if you double click on a really intricate family that is highly detailed it can really slow down your modeling process so let's find out how to do that if you go to file and go down to options you can find user interface down here then you can see double click options if we customize this and we want to change this to either edit type or do nothing if you do nothing it won't do anything when you double click on an element otherwise if you do edit type then it will bring up the edit type screen which is less resource heavy than actually opening up the family so that might be a better way to do it but i'm going to click,0.08-151.51899999999998,533,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=0.08s
103,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,do nothing while we're on this screen you can also see that there are keyboard shortcuts now it's really good to familiarize yourself with the keyboard shortcuts inside of revit it would take a little bit to get used to as with any software but once you have all of the shortcuts in the back of your mind it will be like knowing another language but they will really speed up your processes inside of revit and it will really speed up your workflow and the cool thing is you can actually customize these to be whatever you want so if you've come from autocad or if you've come from working in sketchup or rhino you can easily change things to mimic what they were in those programs so that you don't have to learn a completely different tool set the next tip is talking about selecting things because quite often it's difficult to select what we want to select in the bottom right hand corner you have different selection tools you've got select links which allows you to select links and their elements select underlay elements which allows you to select underlay elements and so forth you can also see some other things here the biggest one is the filter tool you can highlight everything and if say you just want to select these columns then you can click filter check none and then we can go to there should be columns here but since i've grouped them they're under model groups so we can click on that and click ok now those columns are the only things that are selected because let's say if we wanted to nudge these and we've selected something over here then you're moving things that you don't want to move you can also see that drag elements on selection is an option here usually you want this disabled because if you're dragging things when you're trying to select stuff that can be really painful and you can accidentally move things so it's best to have this disabled the next tip is about trying to snap to objects so let's say i wanted to snap to the middle of this column with this wall now you can try and go through this and you can hit tab to try and select different things and that can be quite problem problematic that can be quite annoying you can try and you know zoom in and then really get to that center point which is you know cool but the better way to do it is with shortcuts there are snapping shortcuts which you can use to easily snap to things so to do that it's always going to start with s and then you want to hit the next button say if you want to snap to the midpoint all you'd have to do is click s m and then now it only snaps to mid points which is very handy rather than trying to snap to other things and then you might accidentally lock onto something that you don't want to lock onto you can also use snap to end point snap to intersection uh snap to center,149.92-301.28,534,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=149.92s
104,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,and then also snap to tangent etc etc and it's always going to be starting with s and then if it's to end point it would be s e if it's to intersection s i and so forth the next tip is freaking huge if you've ever wanted to do real-time rendering inside of revit or inside of a 3d modeling program it's really simple with enscape and this isn't a sponsor anything it's free for students which is freaking awesome i use this for pretty much all my projects in uni every workplace i've interned in at the moment also use this program so it's it's extremely good and it's the industry standard at the moment for real-time rendering let me show you how to use it so it's a plug-in once you've installed it inside of revit which is extremely simple you can go up to the top ribbon tab here and you can go to enscape and you just start inside usually you want to be inside a 3d view this isn't just really good for creating quick renders that you might want to show a client or you might want to show your tutors or your professor or whoever you're showing your project to it's really good for that but i also use it mainly as a design tool because now what you can do is fly around your model in a people perspective if that makes sense you are now the height of a human and you can actually walk around your model and see what the spaces are like for a human which is what architecture is all about it's about designing to human scale and it's really hard to do that when you're just working in 2d elevations plans and sections so forth so this is a great tool for actually exploring your design and you can see that there are some materials overlaying here which is creating some problems if i were to render this and you can actually you know see what materials look like next to each other you can see that this is extruding through the wall which isn't meant to happen so it's extremely good for doing that it could be a bit slow if you uh have a really big model where's my door i've got to find the right door but it is extremely awesome and if you add a ground to this you add some trees there's a whole asset library that comes with enscape you can create some really nice looking renders really quickly and easily so let's get out of that next up we've got placing objects which is you know might be thinking that's pretty easy to do but there's a little quick tip here so let's say we wanted to load in a family i'm just going to load in anything here so let's say i wanted to load in this chair you go to architecture component place a component quite often i see a lot of students then placing this in and then having to rotate it with the rotate tool into where they want to put it,298.8-450.479,528,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=298.8s
105,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,another way to do that is by pressing space when placing a component and that's going to rotate it but then let's say you wanted to place it adjacent or parallel to a curve which is pretty difficult to do because it's only rotating 90 degrees let's say i wanted it to follow along this line here if you hover over that line and click space you can see that it now is following that path so you can place the chair and it's going to be following that path which is awesome if you've got a curved wall and you want to place some stuff around that wall the next thing is being able to lock a 3d view because it's so annoying when i'm trying to set up a 3d view like a camera for a render or something and then i accidentally bump it and then it's no longer in the right spot so to change that to lock that view into how you want it to be you can actually use the 3d lock tool and that's just this tool down the bottom here if you click on that and you go save orientation and lock view you can name it that's so annoying um you can name it and then um now there's no way to orbit around that you can still move in and out and you can still pan around but you can't actually orbit around this model which is going to make it really easy to keep that view that you wanted and if you want to unlock it you just press that button again and click unlock view so when hiding or isolating things inside your 3d model it's not a great practice it's not good practice to hide things in a view the better way to do it is by using the visibility or visibility graphics settings by pressing vv or vg i believe it is and what you can actually do is turn off different components from this master override i guess you could say so let's say i wanted to turn off the roof rather than going here and then hiding these in the view by going hide and view category or elements the best way to do it is by coming to vv or vg and then you can press r to go down to rooves and you can untick that and click ok now this is view dependent so it's only going to change it in this view if i go to an east elevation those roofs are still there but if i wanted to turn that off again press vv go to r click rooves and you can hide that in that view really simple for hiding things in a view it's much better practice than than having to go into here and find what you've done with those things so in this elevation you can see we've changed the view to be realistic and we've set up a,447.039-598.0,504,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=447.039s
106,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,pretty nice looking elevation but then if we go to i'm gonna guess our south one it doesn't look as good what you can do to bring those settings over to this elevation rather than having to change all of this manually what you can do is set up a template and these are really good these are used quite often in architecture practices it's a good habit to get into using templates because you don't want to have to change the settings of all of your elevations manually or all your sections manually you want to be able to just apply a template to it which then sets up that view now i'll be honest i haven't done too much of this as a student for my student projects i usually take the hard and long way so definitely get into this practice of setting up templates i don't have any setup that i can show you how you can find templates is by going into the properties to the side here clicking view template and then you can usually set up one see there's already some set up for elevations site sections etc and you can click ok and that's going to apply that view template now nothing's changed because we haven't set this up but by changing these you can change the override um stuff from here so you could turn off all the walls so you could change the wall settings from here and you can apply this across all of the different elevations which is really really cool really easy to manipulate your drawings all the architecture practices i've worked at have templates set up for ground floor plans and for elevations sections site plans so that every time you start a new project it's very easy to just apply templates to your drawings and every time you start a new drawing apply that template the next tip this is a quick one if we were to edit this footprint let's say in the ground bathroom view let's say we wanted it to go to the inside of these walls rather than drawing around with the line tool which is cool it might not be perfect what you can do instead is use the pick line tool you might already know about this but this just picks lines inside your drawing and you can usually do this for autocad files and stuff like that as well that you've inserted into your model and it's just going to make it really easy to follow along it's not always perfect as you can see now we've got over overlapping lines but it's a really cool tool and if you've got curves and stuff like that rather than trying to redraw those curves you can use the pick line tool this next tip is to not drag elements it's you know not a great practice to get into instead you want to input numbers so say i want this to be 50 mils off the,596.16-746.24,507,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=596.16s
107,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,wall that's a good way to do it otherwise using the align tool and i've just clicked a l there to bring up that align tool which is the shortcut otherwise you can find it up in the modify panel and by clicking what you want to align to first and then clicking what you want to align that to then you can bring that over and they are now perfectly in line rather than trying to manually drag that over in line with it which can be quite difficult to do the next thing is constraining to levels or just constraining in general what you can actually do is constrain elements inside your project to be constrained to levels or constrained to other walls things like that so that when you move that wall it's going to move everything else that's constrained to it and this keeps things in proportion this makes sure that things stay in the right spot but it can also mean that if you have too many constraints it can cause errors and problems so you want to be kind of smart about the way you use constraints i use constraints mainly for levels so if i have walls going up to a certain level rather than putting my walls offset say 4000 off of the ground or something like that what i'll do is i'll attach it to a level and this happened in the beginner's course i realized that the floor was not at the correct height and so all of my walls when i changed that floor height we're still stuck in the same place and so then i i would usually have to adjust all of those walls up to meet that level again but instead i've just constrained it to that level so that the floor is constrained to the level and i just change the level and it's going to bring down that floor it's going to bring down those walls just by changing the level because they are all constrained to that level this next tip is if you want to copy some objects across from different views you can use ctrl c or command c to copy say this door over to another um another view then it's also difficult to try and line things up what you can do instead is use control c and then say if we went to level one what you can do is go paste align to selected levels you can align it to the exact same place you can align it to the current view by clicking select levels you can then apply this selection and copy it across multiple levels this is really good if you're doing say like an uh office building you can just design one floor level and then copy that across all of the different levels that you want to paste that to rather than having to,744.8-896.24,492,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=744.8s
108,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,model in say 18 different levels this next tip is a big one because if you don't follow this and you're working with others you're collaborating with others or even just working by yourself it can really  a lot of things up so whenever you're creating a new type or you're changing a material or something like this you want to duplicate it first so let's say we wanted to change this wall and we wanted it to be 250 mils in width if we were to just change this structure to be say 110 and this is going to change this to okay 290 that's going to change all of the walls in this model that have that material or type applied to it instead what you want to do is you would undo that and then duplicate it and then create a new type which is 290 mils and this can get you know pretty busy then when you're looking at all your wall types but that is the correct way to do it because you don't want to be changing stuff that you've previously set up inside the model or changing things that you don't know you're changing because that can create really hair pulling stressful situations this next thing is just a time saver if i'm say opening up a new family most of the time it starts in the documents section but then if i wanted to get to entourage look at this file path it's extremely long and annoying trying to get to the library so what i would do instead you can just let's say i wanted the australian library to be on this side panel here you can just drag this oops you can just drag this and move it to the side now all you have to do is click australia and it's going to bring that up so when it starts here in documents you don't have to go to you know my computer and then find where all your stuff is you can just click australia super super easy this is something i've only just started utilizing but let's say you're in a 3d view and you wanted to look at this top down what you can do is use the view cube which i never really used them back in the day but now i found it's really super helpful and you can click top and it's going to bring this into a top view so then let's say i'm just going to hide this in view you want it to work on this in a 3d view and then you wanted to look at it still in 3d you can do that you don't have to create a ground floor plan for it or go to a roof plan you can do that inside your 3d view and whatever you have selected if you click on that it's going to zoom into that so then also you can look at this in an elevation view and you can bring this around to the,893.68-1043.679,516,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=893.68s
109,20 Revit Tips and Tricks for Beginners I Wish I Knew When I Started Revit,right or the left and you can just look at it in a 2d mode still in a 3d view you might be wondering why that's useful now but trust me as you're working along in a 3d view you're going to use this quite often while we're in the 3d view using section boxes is massive so let's say you wanted to um work on this door inside of here it's going to be really hard to try and work on that in a 3d view you can work on it say in the ground floor plan or this would be on the level 1 floor plan but what you can do is use section boxes now a section box is going to just isolate this from everything else pretty much and you can go up to the modified tab and click section box or you can see that the shortcut for that is bx so if we press that it's going to zoom into that and isolate everything else around it very very helpful you can actually adjust the section box from inside this 3d view by clicking on the section box and then pulling out these little buttons to the side here it's a very easy and quick way to manipulate your 3d views and you can also create some cool views with a section box and to turn it on it's just by pressing this button here if you want to turn it off there you go and if you turn the section box back on now it's not going to isolate that again it's going to create a new section box around everything visible in that view so there we have it that's what i think was probably 20 tips and tricks for revit beginners i hope you found that helpful if you want to check out the the beginner's revit course i highly recommend it it's going to be much easier and quicker to learn revit by following along with this project that i have you can find all the course files and the materials that i use and the families inside the course on my website otherwise if you want to watch it for free it is also on youtube just you don't get the luxury of finding all the project files and following along which is really that key thing to get you learning revit quickly and easily so i'll see you in that course thank you so much for watching take care,1041.919-1167.039,421,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI,https://youtube.com/watch?v=X75tcCXoYSI&t=1041.919s
110,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,i just started a new job and i've been forced to learn archicad and i was thinking i wish there was a tutorial i could watch a 15-minute video that could just get me started so that i can begin learning and begin working on the job and there wasn't anything like that for archicad or for revit so i have a six hour course out there on youtube at the moment definitely highly recommend going through that if you are using or planning to use revit and if you're a student if you're in the industry at the moment you're a graduate you're going to need to know revit so i definitely highly recommend going through the revit beginners course but if you just want a quick video to get you started to teach you the very basics then that is this video right here we're going to design a quick house something small something easy something typical that is uh if you're doing a residential design and we're going to model up that building inside of revit this will really just give you the skills that you need to get started to push you into that revit world so let's get into it so welcome to revit the first thing we're going to want to do is open up a new model this is going to be your project if you want to learn more about families i talk about that in my course but if we click new model it's going to ask us to create a new template file if we go down to the metric architectural template because we're creating an architecture project hit ok it's going to create a new revit file a new project a new model that we can start modeling up this building in so to get started it opens up a level one floor plan and the way revit works is that we can use this floor plan to model up the entire building that will show up in the elevations and sections and 3d views and renders and all that good stuff so what we can do is start off by creating a floor slab and to do that we're going to use this top ribbon at the top here under the build tab and you can click on floor and you can see that there's a little drop down menu there and if you go to floor architecture that's how you can put in a new floor slab so you've got a few options for drawing this floor slab or drawing any shapes in revit you can use a line to create a line that creates your slab or what we're going to do is use the rectangle tool to then form a new floor slab now as you can see as we drag this out the parameters of the floor slab change we could line this up to be the perimeter that we want it to be or we could just place it and then edit these values later and we can do that by clicking this dimension length,0.08-151.20000000000002,522,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=0.08s
111,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,so if we click on that we can actually type in the value we want which is going to be 10 000 and that's going to be millimeters in this case because we're using the metric um architectural template so what that's done is change the value of this line here to 10 000. if we were to change this to 15 000 you can see that it it extends this line here but we're going to keep that as 10 000 and then we're going to select this vertical line which is going to allow us to change the value of the space between here and this line over here and you could actually change this by locking it onto something else if you wanted to make this 16 000 by just typing that in so i'm thinking this design is going to have an l shape so what i'm going to do is click on this bottom line here and we're going to change this dimension to be less than we're going to make maybe go halfway across by dragging this drag end line and dragging this to about 8 000 which is halfway between 16 000 as you can see that's created equal dimensions on both sides so we're going to create another line bring this down and we're going to say another 10 000 type that in come around and you can see that as you're bringing this across it's going to line up with this wall here and lock onto it so you want to snap across to that and i'm going to hit escape to get out of that line and i'm going to hit escape again because it's still going to be creating lines so sometimes you have to press escape a few times and then i want to extend this line down to this new line that we've made at the bottom here and to do that we're going to use the trim and extend tool and if you go up to the top here you can see under the modify tab that there is a trim and extend to corner tool if we click on that and we click the corner that we want to extend to and the line that we want to extend you can see that it's going to create a connection and intersection between these two lines and that's great so once you're happy with your slab you can go ahead and click the green tick because at the moment we are still editing it but by clicking that green tick we can finish the editing mode otherwise if you want to clear everything you've created just now you can hit the red x i don't recommend doing that let's hit the green tick and you can see that it's created a floor slab now that the floor slabs in we're going to want to add in a couple of walls so if i go up to the top architecture tab here you can see that there are architectural walls and if we click on that or click wa to bring that up you can see that we are now in the edit mode again to create walls very similar to creating floors,149.68-301.199,546,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=149.68s
112,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,but before we place these walls we're going to want to edit a few properties first and you can go over to the properties panel on the side here to do that so the first thing we want to look at is what kind of wall are we creating what is the thickness of it what is the wall made out of what are the components of the wall and at the moment you can see that it is a generic 200 millimeter wall the generic is just stating that it is going to have a default material and default properties and it's not going to be you know made out of brick or timber or stone it's going to be generic but if you click on this you can see that there are other options so let's say we wanted a masonry brick wall to do that we can just go ahead and find a brick wall this generic 90 millimeter brick wall looks good but we don't want it to be 90 millimeters this is the the thickness of the wall this is how wide the wall is we want it to be more like 240 which is pretty standard for a brick wall so if we edit the type with this button here and we click on edit structure what we can do is edit the thickness of this brick to be 240 and once we are finished with that we can click ok and click ok again and that has changed that to a 240 millimeter brick but as you can see it hasn't changed the name of it and that can get confusing sometimes so usually whenever you're editing the type of a wall you want to hit duplicate before making any changes and then it will ask you to rename it and then you'll rename it a 240 millimeter brick but in this case we can just change the name of this because we're not using the 90 millimeter brick click ok and you can see that that has changed as we're placing the ball it's going to be placing it to a certain height and to define that height you can see that there is a unconnected height here or a top constraint the top constraint means you can assign a level which would then connect that wall to that level for example you can have it set as the level above or in our case all we'll need to do is define a height for it if it's unconnected this is going to be independent from other materials or other objects in the model and so if we change this to say 4000 then once we place this wall that brick wall is going to be four thousand millimeters high or four meters tall the last thing that we want to look at is the location line which is here if we place a wall on the wall center line what it's going to be doing,299.6-451.28,504,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=299.6s
113,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,is placing that wall on the center line of the point we picked now this would be good for some situations but for us we want to place it so that the wool is uh bound on this edge and then going to the inside of the slab so we can change this location line to be finished face on the interior and you can see that it will now place that wall with the finished face on the interior if we want to flip that we can hit the space button and it can flip it to the side but we're going to keep it like this so what we want to do is now pick a point that we can start our wall line from and that can be this corner here as you bring this down you'll see that it snaps onto the corner of the slab and that's good because we want it to snap onto there you can see that little rectangle that it snaps to so if we click on that we can actually continue creating walls and we're going to keep on drawing around the outside of the slab to draw in these exterior walls and once we finish up you'll see that after we press escape twice it's going to link all of those bulbs together and it's going to create a chain of walls now we want to add in some interior walls to separate the space so if we go ahead and create another wall we can choose a different wall type and i want to go for something that's a bit thinner this interior block work that's a hundred millimeters would probably do the trick for us but we want to make sure that it's going to the right levels again we want to double check all of these properties before we place it you can see that it's defaulted to have the location line on the wall center line and we're just going to change this to be the finished face exterior and the base constraint so this is what the wall is sitting on it's currently sitting on the lowest level which is level one which is good and you can see that we're unable to change the unconnected height value and that's because the wall is going to be constrained to a top constraint which is up to level two what this is saying is that level two is actually four thousand millimeters above level one which is actually what we wanted but if we wanted to change this manually we can click on this little arrow here to the right of that box and we can change it to be unconnected and we can edit that value but instead we're going to constrain it to level two because what this means is that if we were to continue creating walls all over this floor plan and then we changed our mind that it wasn't four thousand millimeters tall we wanted it to be five thousand millimeters tall then rather than having to change every individual wall's height,448.72-599.76,522,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=448.72s
114,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,because they're all unconnected by constraining it to a level all we'd have to do is uh change that level and it would change the value of all of those walls so we're going to keep that top constraint to level two and we're going to start drawing in some internal walls i'm going to bring this across and i'm just going to draw these in so now that we've got our internal walls and we're going to want to add some doors and again we're going to go to the architecture tab and we're going to hit the door button or we can press dr and at the moment we've got a single flush door which is 915 millimeters wide with a height of 2134 millimeters and that'll do just fine that's a pretty standard door but you can also change this with the drop down menu otherwise you can also load in other doors by going load family and here we can find our library and we can find where doors are and we can also have a look at some of these other doors by using the up or down arrows to scroll through and look at a preview of all of these doors but for now we're going to keep using this default door so the main entrance of our building is actually going to be down in this corner here the main entrance is going to come into here and into a main living space so let's go ahead and place a door there you can see that it's locked onto the middle you can see that once we place that these temporary dimensions are showing 530.5 millimeters from this wall and 530.5 from this wall so let's say that we actually wanted our door to swing from the other side all you'd have to do is click on that door and you can press this arrow button here and you can see that you can flip it either side we're going to have it flipping in and swinging like this now we're just going to add in a few more doors 500 mils of a visible and again 500 millimeters of this wool so now let's say we wanted to add an opening in between the entrance and the living room all we'd have to do is select that wall and hit wall opening at the top here we can then decide on how far across we want this opening to go and we're just going to select one way and then come across 2500 millimeters and you can edit that afterwards by clicking on this temporary dimension and draw that in now at the moment you can select this to have a look at the properties now at the moment you can see that it's currently constrained the base is,597.92-750.24,477,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=597.92s
115,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,constrained to level one so the bottom of the opening is on the ground floor which is at the height of zero which is good and then the top constraint is up to level two which was four thousand millimeters tall but then you can see that the top offset is also off by fifteen hundred and sixty one point six millimeters so the head height of this opening is fifteen hundred and sixty millimeters below level two which is four thousand millimeters tall and that's pretty good but let's say we wanted to have a look at this in a 3d view to do that we can actually go up to the 3d button at the top here we can go down to view and then find 3d view so let's click on that and now we've got a 3d model of our building that we've already put in we can orbit around the model by holding down the scroll button and pressing shift at the same time and then just by panning around the model like this otherwise you can hold the scroll wheel down to just pan across so you can see that that is the opening we've just placed in you can see the doors we're placing and these internal walls and they're all to the correct height which is really good to go back to our level one view we can go down to that button at the top here or we can go down to the project browser which is going to give us all of our views and drawings for example we've got ceiling plans elevations and floor plans at the moment but let's go back to our level one floor plan so now we're going to want to add in some windows if we go back to the architecture tab and click on window or press wn we can then find some more windows that we like by either picking them from the list here or loading in families and we can then choose one we like and start to place them in now some of these you can adjust the values of and the parameters of later once you've placed it but for now we're going to go ahead and place some of these windows around so now you can see we've got some windows in i've just placed them around randomly but they all look the same so let's say that this one was actually a lot wider than some of the other ones around the place so to change the width of it what we're going to want to do is go to edit type and you can see that it's got a defined width this is a 406 millimeter by 610 millimeter window but you can see under dimensions that there are ways to change these parameters now if we were to change this to say 600 wide you're going to see that that's going to change this window width but it's also going to change the width of,748.88-898.399,511,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=748.88s
116,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,all of these other windows that we've placed and that's because revit is a bim building information modeling software and that's one of the bonus and one of the perks of using bim because it is very adaptive but what if we didn't want to change all of these windows that's when you would hit duplicate rename this to a 600 millimeter by 610 millimeter uh window click ok and then make that edit now i'm just going to leave this as b because i hope that makes sense to you now you can probably see how this is going to be problematic when you're working with other people on the same model because if you make a change to this and someone else has placed this this family in other parts of the model and you don't see it then you'll be changing stuff that you won't be able to see and you can cause some big problems so that's why whenever you're making a change to a family or a wall type or a window or anything like that always duplicate it first and then you can make the change now the final thing to do if we go to our 3d view you can see that we've got our windows in we've got our doors in and our openings our windows aren't exactly in the right heights that we want them to be so to change this what we can do is click on the window and you can see there's a seal height and a head height now changing one of these is going to change the other because it's parametric if we were to change the seal height which is actually the lowest point of the window where the sill is that's how far it is off of the ground so with a sill height of 915 this is going to mean that the seal is 915 millimeters above the ground so let's change this to 1600 and once we apply those changes you can see it's changed to now be sixteen hundred millimeters above from that ground level but the head height is also change which is this top height here now obviously changing one of them is going to change the other if you wanted to change the height of the window as in how high it is that's when you would go into the edit type and change the height of it so now all we need to do is add in a roof and that can be a bit tricky but it's actually really quite simple in revit so if we go back to our level one floor plan and we click on the architecture tab again go to build a roof we can choose either roof by footprint roof by extrusion or roof by face what i usually use 99 of the time is a roof by footprint so we're trying to create the roof on the level one floor plan,896.48-1047.36,501,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=896.48s
117,Revit Quick Start Tutorial for Beginners - Start Using Revit Now!,which is going to assign the roof to be on level one which is zero millimeters from ground level what revit's trying to tell us with this uh error message is that why would we want the roof to be on the lowest level we want this to go up to a level above and the roof is actually going to sit on top of all of the walls which are 4 000 millimeters tall but these are also constrained to level two so we want the wall or we want the roof to sit on level two as well so yes let's change this to level two now similar to the floor slab we are now using the same idea that we started with where you've got the line tool you've got rectangles and other shapes that you can use including splines and arcs and all of that good stuff and we're going to have to choose a roof type before we place the roof you can see that the base level can be changed after we've done this so we could change this to level one but again that's going to be on the lowest level so we don't want to do that we want to add this to level two and there's a few settings we can change here but what we want to do is start drawing this in so we're going to use the line tool or better yet we're going to pick the lines of these outer walls and create a roof around that we can do that by using the pick line tool so let's click these outside lines and you're going to see them start to draw in the shape of our roof all i'm doing is selecting these lines when they turn blue and you can see that that's created that shape for us now if we create this by clicking the green tick what you're going to see is that we've got a roof and that looks pretty damn good and so there you have it that's how you create a basic house in revit as you can see we've now got a floor plan of that house we've got a 3d view of that house we've got some elevations and sections of that house so you can see that we've got elevations here and bob's your uncle that's how you create a basic house in revit now this was a really basic get you started guide if you'd really like to dig deep and learn all of the beginner tools and tips and tricks to learn revit you can feel free to go through my revit course for beginners for students if you're starting revit this is for you that course is available here on youtube and you can check it out with the link in the description below or by pressing it here thank you so much and i'll catch you in that video [Music] you,1045.36-1203.28,498,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHQQz6QXEMU&t=1045.36s
